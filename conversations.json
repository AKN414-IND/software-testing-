The structure of the text directly reflects the pedagogical approach\nand incorporates the latest innovations in testing, including modern types\nof software such as OO, Web applications, and embedded software. The\nbook contains numerous examples throughout. An instructor\u2019s solution\nmanual, PowerPoint slides, sample syllabi, additional examples and up-\ndates, testing tools for students, and example software programs in Java\nare available on an extensive Web site at www.introsoftwaretesting.com.\n\nPaul Ammann, PhD, is an Associate Professor of software engineer-\ning at George Mason University. He received an outstanding teaching\naward in 2007 from the Volgenau School of Information Technology and\nEngineering. Dr. Ammann earned an AB degree in computer science\nfrom Dartmouth College and MS and PhD degrees in computer science\nfrom the University of Virginia.\n\nJeff Offutt, PhD, is a Professor of software engineering at George\nMason University. He is editor-in-chief of the Journal of Software Testing,\nVerification and Reliability; chair of the steering committee for the IEEE\nInternational Conference on Software Testing, Verification, and Valida-\ntion; and on the editorial boards for several journals. He recived the\noutstanding teacher award from the Volgenau School of Information\nTechnology and Engineering in 2003. Dr. Offutt earned a BS degree in\nmathematics and data processing from Morehead State University and\nMS and PhD degrees in computer science from the Georgia Institute of\nTechnology.\n\ni\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nii\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nINTRODUCTION TO\nSOFTWARE\nTESTING\n\nPaul Ammann\nGeorge Mason University\n\nJeff Offutt\nGeorge Mason University\n\niii\n\n\n\nCAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS\n\nCambridge, New York, Melbourne, Madrid, Cape Town, Singapore, S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nCambridge University Press\nThe Edinburgh Building, Cambridge CB2 8RU, UK\n\nFirst published in print format\n\nISBN-13    978-0-521-88038-1\n\nISBN-13 978-0-511-39330-3\n\n\u00a9 Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt 2008\n\n2008\n\nInformation on this title: www.cambridge.org/9780521880381\n\nThis publication is in copyright.

to\nproducing high-quality software. It is designed to be used as the primary textbook\nin either an undergraduate or graduate course on software testing, as a supplement\nto a general course on software engineering or data structures, and as a resource\nfor software test engineers and developers. This book has a number of unique\nfeatures:\n\n\ufffd It organizes the complex and confusing landscape of test coverage criteria with\na novel and extremely simple structure. At a technical level, software testing is\nbased on satisfying coverage criteria. The book\u2019s central observation is that there\nare few truly different coverage criteria, each of which fits easily into one of four\ncategories: graphs, logical expressions, input space, and syntax structures. This\nnot only simplifies testing, but it also allows a convenient and direct theoretical\ntreatment of each category. This approach contrasts strongly with the traditional\nview of testing, which treats testing at each phase in the development process\ndifferently.\n\n\ufffd It is designed and written to be a textbook. The writing style is direct, it builds the\nconcepts from the ground up with a minimum of required background, and it in-\ncludes lots of examples, homework problems, and teaching materials. It provides\na balance of theory and practical application, presenting testing as a collection\nof objective, quantitative activities that can be measured and repeated. The the-\noretical concepts are presented when needed to support the practical activities\nthat test engineers follow.\n\n\ufffd It assumes that testing is part of a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals\ndevelop higher-quality software. Testing is not an anti-engineering activity, and\nit is not an inherently destructive process. Neither is it only for testing specialists\nor domain experts who know little about programming or math.\n\n\ufffd It is designed with modular, interconnecting pieces; thus it can be used in multi-\nple courses. Most of the book requires only basic discrete math and introductory\nprogramming, and the parts that need more background are clearly marked. By\n\nxv\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nxvi Preface\n\nusing the appropriate sections, this book can support several classes, as described\nlater in the preface.\n\n\ufffd It assumes the reader is learning to be an engineer whose goal is to produce the\nbest possible software with the lowest possible cost. The concepts in this book\nare well grounded in theory, are practical, and most are currently in use.\n\nWHY SHOULD THIS BOOK BE USED?\n\nNot very long ago, software development companies could afford to employ pro-\ngrammers who could not test and testers who could not program. For most of the\nindustry, it was not necessary for either group to know the technical principles be-\nhind software testing or even software development. Software testing in industry\nhistorically has been a nontechnical activity. Industry viewed testing primarily from\nthe managerial and process perspective and had limited expectations of practition-\ners\u2019 technical training.\n\nAs the software engineering profession matures, and as software becomes more\npervasive in everyday life, there are increasingly stringent requirements for software\nreliability, maintainability, and security. Industry must respond to these changes by,\namong other things, improving the way software is tested. This requires increased\ntechnical expertise on the part of test engineers, as well as increased emphasis on\ntesting by software developers. The good news is that the knowledge and technol-\nogy are available and based on over 30 years of research and practice. This book\nputs that knowledge into a form that students, test engineers, test managers, and\ndevelopers can access.\n\nAt the same time, it is relatively rare to find courses that teach testing in univer-\nsities. Only a few undergraduate courses exist, almost no masters degree programs\nin computer science or software engineering require a course in software testing,\nand only a few dozen have an elective course. Not only is testing not covered as an\nessential part of undergraduate computer science education, most computer science\nstudents either never gain any knowledge about testing, or see only a few lectures\nas part of a general course in software engineering.\n\nThe authors of this book have been teaching software testing to software en-\ngineering and computer science students for more than 15 years. Over that time\nwe somewhat reluctantly came to the conclusion that no one was going to write\nthe book we wanted to use. Rather, to get the book we wanted, we would have to\nwrite it.\n\nPrevious testing books have presented software testing as a relatively simple\nsubject that relies more on process than technical understanding of how software\nis constructed, as a complicated and fractured subject that requires detailed under-\nstanding of numerous software development technologies, or as a completely the-\noretical subject that can be mastered only by mathematicians and theoretical com-\nputer scientists. Most books on software testing are organized around the phases in\na typical software development lifecycle, an approach that has the unfortunate side\neffect of obscuring common testing themes. Finally, most testing books are written\nas reference books, not textbooks. As a result, only instructors with prior expertise\nin software testing can easily teach the subject. This book is accessible to instructors\nwho are not already testing experts.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nPreface xvii\n\nThis book differs from other books on software testing in other important ways.\nMany books address managing the testing process. While this is important, it is\nequally important to give testers specific techniques grounded in basic theory. This\nbook provides a balance of theory and practical application. This is important in-\nformation that software companies must have; however, this book focuses specif-\nically on the technical nuts-and-bolts issues of designing and creating tests. Other\ntesting books currently on the market focus on specific techniques or activities,\nsuch as system testing or unit testing. This book is intended to be comprehensive\nover the entire software development process and to cover as many techniques as\npossible.\n\nAs stated previously, the motivation for this book is to support courses in soft-\nware testing. Our first target was our own software testing course in our Soft-\nware Engineering MS program at George Mason University. This popular elective\nis taught to about 30 computer science and software engineering students every\nsemester. We also teach PhD seminars in software testing, industry short courses\non specialized aspects, and lectures on software testing in various undergraduate\ncourses. Although few undergraduate courses on software testing exist, we believe\nthat they should exist, and we expect they will in the near future. Most testing books\nare not designed for classroom use. We specifically wrote this book to support our\nclassroom activities, and it is no accident that the syllabus for our testing course,\navailable on the book\u2019s Web site (www.introsoftwaretesting.com), closely follows\nthe table of contents for this book.\n\nThis book includes numerous carefully worked examples to help students and\nteachers alike learn the sometimes complicated concepts. The instructor\u2019s resources\ninclude high-quality powerpoint slides, presentation hints, solutions to exercises,\nand working software. Our philosophy is that we are doing more than writing a\nbook; we are offering our course to the community. One of our goals was to write\nmaterial that is scholarly and true to the published research literature, but that is\nalso accessible to nonresearchers. Although the presentation in the book is quite a\nbit different from the research papers that the material is derived from, the essen-\ntial ideas are true to the literature. To make the text flow more smoothly, we have\nremoved the references from the presentation. For those interested in the research\ngenealogy, each chapter closes with a bibliographic notes section that summarizes\nwhere the concepts come from.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nStudents who read and use this book will learn the fundamental principles behind\nsoftware testing, and how to apply these principles to produce better software,\nfaster. They will not only become better programmers, they will also be prepared\nto carry out high-quality testing activities for their future employers. Instructors\nwill be able to use this book in the classroom, even without prior practical exper-\ntise in software testing. The numerous exercises and thought-provoking problems,\nclassroom-ready and classroom-tested slides, and suggested outside activities make\nthis material teachable by instructors who are not already experts in software test-\ning. Research students such as beginning PhD students will find this book to be an\ninvaluable resource as a starting point to the field. The theory is sound and clearly\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nxviii Preface\n\npresented, the practical applications reveal what is useful and what is not, and the\nadvanced reading and bibliographic notes provide pointers into the literature. Al-\nthough the set of research students in software testing is a relatively small audi-\nence, we believe it is a key audience, because a common, easily achievable baseline\nwould reduce the effort required for research students to join the community of\ntesting researchers. Researchers who are already familiar with the field will find the\ncriteria-approach to be novel and interesting. Some may disagree with the pedagog-\nical approach, but we have found that the view that testing is an application of only\na few criteria to a very few software structures to be very helpful to our research.\nWe hope that testing research in the future will draw away from searches for more\ncriteria to novel uses and evaluations of existing criteria.\n\nTesters in the industry will find this book to be an invaluable collection of tech-\nniques that will help improve their testing, no matter what their current process is.\nThe criteria presented here are intended to be used as a \u201ctoolbox\u201d of tricks that\ncan be used to find faults. Developers who read this book will find numerous ways\nto improve their own software. Their self-testing activities can become more effi-\ncient and effective, and the discussions of software faults that test engineers search\nfor will help developers avoid them. To paraphrase a famous parable, if you want\nto teach a person to be a better fisherman, explain how and where the fish swim.\nFinally, managers will find this book to be a useful explanation of how clever test\nengineers do their job, and of how test tools work. They will be able to make more\neffective decisions regarding hiring, promotions, and purchasing tools.\n\nHOW CAN THIS BOOK BE USED?\n\nA major advantage of the structure of this book is that it can be easily used for\nseveral different courses. Most of the book depends on material that is taught very\nearly in college and some high schools: basic concepts from data structures and dis-\ncrete math. The sections are organized so that the early material in each chapter\nis accessible to less advanced students, and material that requires more advanced\nknowledge is clearly marked.\n\nSpecifically, the book defines six separate sets of chapter sections that form\nstreams through the book:\n\n1. A module within a CS II course\n2. A sophomore-level course on software testing\n3. A module in a general software engineering course\n4. A senior-level course on software testing\n5. A first-year MS level course on software testing\n6. An advanced graduate research-oriented course on software testing\n7. Industry practioner relevant sections\nThe stream approach is illustrated in the abbreviated table of contents in\n\nthe figure shown on pp. xix\u2013xx. Each chapter section is marked with which stream\nit belongs too. Of course, individual instructors, students, and readers may prefer\nto adapt the stream to their own interests or purposes. We suggest that the first\ntwo sections of Chapter 1 and the first two sections of Chapter 6 are appropriate\nreading for a module in a data structures (CS II) class, to be followed by a simple\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nPreface xix\n\nStream 1: Module in a CS II course.\n\nStream 2: Sophomore-level course on software testing.\n\nStream 3: Module in a general software engineering course.\n\nStream 4: Senior-level course on software testing.\n\nStream 5: First-year MS course on software testing.\n\nStream 6: Advanced graduate research-oriented course on software testing.\n\nStream 7: Industry practitioner relevant sections\n\nSTREAMS\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nPart I: Overview\nChapter 1.

Our favorite is to ask the students to retrieve one of their previously\ngraded programs and satisfy some simple test criterion like branch coverage. We\noffer points for every fault found, driving home two concepts: an \u201cA\u201d grade doesn\u2019t\nmean the program always works, and finding faults is a good thing.\n\nThe sophomore-level course on software testing (stream 2) is designed to imme-\ndiately follow a data structures course (CS II).

This includes sections in Chap-\nter 2 on data flow testing, sections that involve integration testing of multiple mod-\nules, and sections that rely on grammars or finite state machines. Most senior com-\nputer science students will have seen this material in their other courses. Most of the\nsections that appear in stream 4 but not stream 2 could be added to stream 2 with\nappropriate short introductions.

A software developer can expect to use the concepts pre-\nsented in this book many times during his or her career. This chapter introduces the\nsubject of software testing by describing the activities of a test engineer, defining a\nnumber of key terms, and then explaining the central notion of test coverage.\n\nSoftware is a key ingredient in many of the devices and systems that pervade\nour society. Software defines the behavior of network routers, financial networks,\ntelephone switching networks, the Web, and other infrastructure of modern life.\nSoftware is an essential component of embedded applications that control exotic\napplications such as airplanes, spaceships, and air traffic control systems, as well as\nmundane appliances such as watches, ovens, cars, DVD players, garage door open-\ners, cell phones, and remote controllers. Modern households have over 50 proces-\nsors, and some new cars have over 100; all of them running software that optimistic\nconsumers assume will never fail! Although many factors affect the engineering of\nreliable software, including, of course, careful design and sound process manage-\nment, testing is the primary method that the industry uses to evaluate software un-\nder development. Fortunately, a few basic software testing concepts can be used\nto design tests for a large variety of software applications. A goal of this book is\nto present these concepts in such a way that the student or practicing engineer can\neasily apply them to any software testing situation.\n\nThis textbook differs from other software testing books in several respects.\nThe most important difference is in how it views testing techniques. In his land-\nmark book Software Testing Techniques, Beizer wrote that testing is simple \u2013 all\na tester needs to do is \u201cfind a graph and cover it.\u201d Thanks to Beizer\u2019s insight, it\nbecame evident to us that the myriad testing techniques present in the literature\nhave much more in common than is obvious at first glance. Testing techniques typ-\nically are presented in the context of a particular software artifact (for example, a\nrequirements document or code) or a particular phase of the lifecycle (for exam-\nple, requirements analysis or implementation). Unfortunately, such a presentation\nobscures the underlying similarities between techniques. This book clarifies these\nsimilarities.\n\n3\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n4 Overview\n\nIt turns out that graphs do not characterize all testing techniques well; other\nabstract models are necessary. Much to our surprise, we have found that a small\nnumber of abstract models suffice: graphs, logical expressions, input domain char-\nacterizations, and syntactic descriptions. The main contribution of this book is to\nsimplify testing by classifying coverage criteria into these four categories, and this is\nwhy Part II of this book has exactly four chapters.\n\nThis book provides a balance of theory and practical application, thereby pre-\nsenting testing as a collection of objective, quantitative activities that can be mea-\nsured and repeated. The theory is based on the published literature, and presented\nwithout excessive formalism. Most importantly, the theoretical concepts are pre-\nsented when needed to support the practical activities that test engineers follow.\nThat is, this book is intended for software developers.\n\n1.1 ACTIVITIES OF A TEST ENGINEER\n\nIn this book, a test engineer is an information technology (IT) professional who is in\ncharge of one or more technical test activities, including designing test inputs, pro-\nducing test case values, running test scripts, analyzing results, and reporting results\nto developers and managers. Although we cast the description in terms of test engi-\nneers, every engineer involved in software development should realize that he or she\nsometimes wears the hat of a test engineer. The reason is that each software artifact\nproduced over the course of a product\u2019s development has, or should have, an asso-\nciated set of test cases, and the person best positioned to define these test cases is\noften the designer of the artifact. A test manager is in charge of one or more test en-\ngineers. Test managers set test policies and processes, interact with other managers\non the project, and otherwise help the engineers do their work.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows some of the major activities of test engineers. A test engi-\nneer must design tests by creating test requirements. These requirements are then\n\nTest\nEngineer\n\nTest\nDesigns\n\nExecutable\nTests\n\nComputer EvaluateP Output\n\nTest\nEngineer Test\n\nEngineer\n\ndesign instantiate\n\nexecute\n\n}\n\nTest\nManager\n\nFigure 1.1.

These ex-\necutable tests are run against the software, denoted P in the figure, and the results\nare evaluated to determine if the tests reveal a fault in the software. These activities\nmay be carried out by one person or by several, and the process is monitored by a\ntest manager.\n\nOne of a test engineer\u2019s most powerful tools is a formal coverage criterion. For-\nmal coverage criteria give test engineers ways to decide what test inputs to use dur-\ning testing, making it more likely that the tester will find problems in the program\nand providing greater assurance that the software is of high quality and reliability.\nCoverage criteria also provide stopping rules for the test engineers. The technical\ncore of this book presents the coverage criteria that are available, describes how\nthey are supported by tools (commercial and otherwise), explains how they can best\nbe applied, and suggests how they can be integrated into the overall development\nprocess.\n\nSoftware testing activities have long been categorized into levels, and two kinds\nof levels have traditionally been used. The most often used level categorization is\nbased on traditional software process steps. Although most types of tests can only\nbe run after some part of the software is implemented, tests can be designed and\nconstructed during all software development steps. The most time-consuming parts\nof testing are actually the test design and construction, so test activities can and\nshould be carried out throughout development. The second-level categorization is\nbased on the attitude and thinking of the testers.\n\n1.1.1 Testing Levels Based on Software Activity\n\nTests can be derived from requirements and specifications, design artifacts, or the\nsource code. A different level of testing accompanies each distinct software devel-\nopment activity:\n\n\ufffd Acceptance Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to requirements.\n\ufffd System Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to architectural design.\n\ufffd Integration Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to subsystem design.\n\ufffd Module Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to detailed design.\n\ufffd Unit Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to implementation.\n\nFigure 1.2 illustrates a typical scenario for testing levels and how they relate to\nsoftware development activities by isolating each step. Information for each test\nlevel is typically derived from the associated development activity. Indeed, stan-\ndard advice is to design the tests concurrently with each development activity, even\nthough the software will not be in an executable form until the implementation\nphase. The reason for this advice is that the mere process of explicitly articulat-\ning tests can identify defects in design decisions that otherwise appear reasonable.\nEarly identification of defects is by far the best means of reducing their ultimate\ncost. Note that this diagram is not intended to imply a waterfall process. The syn-\nthesis and analysis activities generically apply to any development process.\n\nThe requirements analysis phase of software development captures the cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs. Acceptance testing is designed to determine whether the completed\nsoftware in fact meets these needs. In other words, acceptance testing probes\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n6 Overview\n\nRequirements\nAnalysis\n\nArchitectural\nDesign\n\nSubsystem\nDesign\n\nDetailed Design\n\nImplementation Unit\nTest\n\nModule\nTest\n\nSystem\nTest\n\nIntegration\nTest\n\nAcceptance\nTest\n\nTest\n\nDesign\n\nInformation\n\nFigure 1.2.

Acceptance testing must involve\nusers or other individuals who have strong domain knowledge.\n\nThe architectural design phase of software development chooses components\nand connectors that together realize a system whose specification is intended to\nmeet the previously identified requirements. System testing is designed to determine\nwhether the assembled system meets its specifications. It assumes that the pieces\nwork individually, and asks if the system works as a whole. This level of testing usu-\nally looks for design and specification problems. It is a very expensive place to find\nlower-level faults and is usually not done by the programmers, but by a separate\ntesting team.\n\nThe subsystem design phase of software development specifies the structure and\nbehavior of subsystems, each of which is intended to satisfy some function in the\noverall architecture. Often, the subsystems are adaptations of previously developed\nsoftware. Integration testing is designed to assess whether the interfaces between\nmodules (defined below) in a given subsystem have consistent assumptions and com-\nmunicate correctly. Integration testing must assume that modules work correctly.\nSome testing literature uses the terms integration testing and system testing inter-\nchangeably; in this book, integration testing does not refer to testing the integrated\nsystem or subsystem. Integration testing is usually the responsibility of members of\nthe development team.\n\nThe detailed design phase of software development determines the structure and\nbehavior of individual modules. A program unit, or procedure, is one or more con-\ntiguous program statements, with a name that other parts of the software use to\ncall it. Units are called functions in C and C++, procedures or functions in Ada,\nmethods in Java, and subroutines in Fortran. A module is a collection of related\nunits that are assembled in a file, package, or class. This corresponds to a file in\nC, a package in Ada, and a class in C++ and Java. Module testing is designed to\nassess individual modules in isolation, including how the component units interact\nwith each other and their associated data structures. Most software development\norganizations make module testing the responsibility of the programmer.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nImplementation is the phase of software development that actually produces\ncode. Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished. This turns out to be\na very simple fault to find during unit testing; indeed analysis showed that almost\nany unit level coverage criterion would have found this multimillion dollar mistake.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n8 Overview\n\nThe Pentium bug not only illustrates the difference in testing levels, but it is also\none of the best arguments for paying more attention to unit testing. There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nThis model does not distinguish between a program\u2019s incorrect behavior and a mis-\ntake within the program, and does very little to help develop software that is reliable\nor safe.\n\nIn Level 1 testing, the purpose is to show correctness. While a significant step up\nfrom the naive level 0, this has the unfortunate problem that in any but the most triv-\nial of programs, correctness is virtually impossible to either achieve or demonstrate.\nSuppose we run a collection of tests and find no failures. What do we know? Should\nwe assume that we have good software or just bad tests? Since the goal of correct-\nness is impossible, test engineers usually have no strict goal, real stopping rule, or\nformal test technique. If a development manager asks how much testing remains to\nbe done, the test manager has no way to answer the question. In fact, test managers\nare in a powerless position because they have no way to quantitatively express or\nevaluate their work.\n\nIn Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures. Although looking for failures\nis certainly a valid goal, it is also a negative goal. Testers may enjoy finding the\nproblem, but the developers never want to find problems \u2013 they want the software\nto work (level 1 thinking is natural for the developers). Thus, level 2 testing puts\ntesters and developers into an adversarial relationship, which can be bad for team\nmorale. Beyond that, when our primary goal is to look for failures, we are still left\nwondering what to do if no failures are found. Is our work done? Is our software\nvery good, or is the testing weak? Having confidence in when testing is complete is\nan important goal for all testers.\n\nThe thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing\ncan show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. This lets us accept the fact\nthat whenever we use software, we incur some risk. The risk may be small and the\nconsequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catas-\ntrophic, but risk is always there. This allows us to realize that the entire develop-\nment team wants the same thing \u2013 to reduce the risk of using the software. In level 3\ntesting, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.\n\nOnce the testers and developers are on the same \u201cteam,\u201d an organization can\nprogress to real Level 4 testing. Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental disci-\npline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating\ntests that cause the software to fail is only one. Adopting this mindset, test engi-\nneers can become the technical leaders of the project (as is common in many other\nengineering disciplines). They have the primary responsibility of measuring and im-\nproving software quality, and their expertise should help the developers. An analogy\nthat Beizer used is that of a spell checker. We often think that the purpose of a spell\nchecker is to find misspelled words, but in fact, the best purpose of a spell checker\nis to improve our ability to spell. Every time the spell checker finds an incorrectly\nspelled word, we have the opportunity to learn how to spell the word correctly. The\nspell checker is the \u201cexpert\u201d on spelling quality. In the same way, level 4 testing\nmeans that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to pro-\nduce high quality software. The testers should train your developers.\n\nAs a reader of this book, you probably start at level 0, 1, or 2. Most software\ndevelopers go through these levels at some stage in their careers. If you work in\nsoftware development, you might pause to reflect on which testing level describes\nyour company or team. The rest of this chapter should help you move to level 2\nthinking, and to understand the importance of level 3. Subsequent chapters will give\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n10 Overview\n\nyou the knowledge, skills, and tools to be able to work at level 3. The ultimate goal\nof this book is to provide a philosophical basis that will allow readers to become\n\u201cchange agents\u201d in their organizations for level 4 thinking, and test engineers to\nbecome software quality experts.\n\n1.1.3 Automation of Test Activities\n\nSoftware testing is expensive and labor intensive. Software testing requires up to\n50% of software development costs, and even more for safety-critical applications.\nOne of the goals of software testing is to automate as much as possible, thereby signi-\nficantly reducing its cost, minimizing human error, and making regression testing\neasier.\n\nSoftware engineers sometimes distinguish revenue tasks, which contribute di-\nrectly to the solution of a problem, from excise tasks, which do not. For example,\ncompiling a Java class is a classic excise task because, although necessary for the\nclass to become executable, compilation contributes nothing to the particular behav-\nior of that class. In contrast, determining which methods are appropriate to define a\ngiven data abstraction as a Java class is a revenue task. Excise tasks are candidates\nfor automation; revenue tasks are not. Software testing probably has more excise\ntasks than any other aspect of software development. Maintaining test scripts, re-\nrunning tests, and comparing expected results with actual results are all common\nexcise tasks that routinely consume large chunks of test engineer\u2019s time. Automat-\ning excise tasks serves the test engineer in many ways. First, eliminating excise tasks\neliminates drudgery, thereby making the test engineers job more satisfying. Second,\nautomation frees up time to focus on the fun and challenging parts of testing, namely\nthe revenue tasks. Third, automation can help eliminate errors of omission, such as\nfailing to update all the relevant files with the new set of expected results. Fourth,\nautomation eliminates some of the variance in test quality caused by differences in\nindividual\u2019s abilities.\n\nMany testing tasks that defied automation in the past are now candidates for such\ntreatment due to advances in technology. For example, generating test cases that\nsatisfy given test requirements is typically a hard problem that requires intervention\nfrom the test engineer. However, there are tools, both research and commercial,\nthat automate this task to varying degrees.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.1.\n\n1.

The following exercise is intended to encourage you to think of testing in a\nmore rigorous way than you may be used to. The exercise also hints at the\nstrong relationship between specification clarity, faults, and test cases.1\n\n(a) Write a Java method with the signature\npublic static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)\n\nThe method should return a Vector of objects that are in either of the\ntwo argument Vectors.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 11\n\n(b) Upon reflection, you may discover a variety of defects and ambiguities\nin the given assignment.

You might wish to illustrate your spec-\nification with examples drawn from your test cases.\n\n1.2 SOFTWARE TESTING LIMITATIONS AND TERMINOLOGY\n\nAs said in the previous section, one of the most important limitations of software\ntesting is that testing can show only the presence of failures, not their absence. This\nis a fundamental, theoretical limitation; generally speaking, the problem of finding\nall failures in a program is undecidable. Testers often call a successful (or effective)\ntest one that finds an error. While this is an example of level 2 thinking, it is also a\ncharacterization that is often useful and that we will use later in this book.\n\nThe rest of this section presents a number of terms that are important in software\ntesting and that will be used later in this book. Most of these are taken from stan-\ndards documents, and although the phrasing is ours, we try to be consistent with the\nstandards. Useful standards for reading in more detail are the IEEE Standard Glos-\nsary of Software Engineering Terminology, DOD-STD-2167A and MIL-STD-498\nfrom the US Department of Defense, and the British Computer Society\u2019s Standard\nfor Software Component Testing.\n\nOne of the most important distinctions to make is between validation and verifi-\ncation.\n\nDefinition 1.1 Validation: The process of evaluating software at the end of\nsoftware development to ensure compliance with intended usage.\n\nDefinition 1.2 Verification: The process of determining whether the products\nof a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements\nestablished during the previous phase.\n\nVerification is usually a more technical activity that uses knowledge about the\nindividual software artifacts, requirements, and specifications. Validation usually\ndepends on domain knowledge; that is, knowledge of the application for which the\nsoftware is written. For example, validation of software for an airplane requires\nknowledge from aerospace engineers and pilots.\n\nThe acronym \u201cIV&V\u201d stands for \u201cindependent verification and validation,\u201d\nwhere \u201cindependent\u201d means that the evaluation is done by nondevelopers. Some-\ntimes the IV&V team is within the same project, sometimes the same company, and\nsometimes it is entirely an external entity. In part because of the independent nature\nof IV&V, the process often is not started until the software is complete and is often\ndone by people whose expertise is in the application domain rather than software\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n12 Overview\n\ndevelopment. This can sometimes mean that validation is given more weight than\nverification.\n\nTwo terms that we have already used are fault and failure. Understanding this dis-\ntinction is the first step in moving from level 0 thinking to level 1 thinking. We adopt\nthe definition of software fault, error, and failure from the dependability community.\n\nDefinition 1.3 Software Fault: A static defect in the software.\n\nDefinition 1.4 Software Error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifes-\ntation of some fault.\n\nDefinition 1.5 Software Failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to\nthe requirements or other description of the expected behavior.\n\nConsider a medical doctor making a diagnosis for a patient. The patient enters\nthe doctor\u2019s office with a list of failures (that is, symptoms). The doctor then must\ndiscover the fault, or root cause of the symptom. To aid in the diagnosis, a doctor\nmay order tests that look for anomalous internal conditions, such as high blood\npressure, an irregular heartbeat, high levels of blood glucose, or high cholesterol. In\nour terminology, these anomalous internal conditions correspond to errors.\n\nWhile this analogy may help the student clarify his or her thinking about faults,\nerrors, and failures, software testing and a doctor\u2019s diagnosis differ in one crucial\nway. Specifically, faults in software are design mistakes. They do not appear spon-\ntaneously, but rather exist as a result of some (unfortunate) decision by a human.\nMedical problems (as well as faults in computer system hardware), on the other\nhand, are often a result of physical degradation. This distinction is important be-\ncause it explains the limits on the extent to which any process can hope to control\nsoftware faults. Specifically, since no foolproof way exists to catch arbitrary mis-\ntakes made by humans, we cannot eliminate all faults from software. In colloquial\nterms, we can make software development foolproof, but we cannot, and should not\nattempt to, make it damn-foolproof.\n\nFor a more technical example of the definitions of fault, error, and failure, con-\nsider the following Java method:\n\npublic static int numZero (int[] x) {\n// Effects: if x == null throw NullPointerException\n// else return the number of occurrences of 0 in x\nint count = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length; i++)\n{\n\nif (x[i] == 0)\n{\n\ncount++;\n}\n\n}\nreturn count;\n\n}\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nThe fault in this program is that it starts looking for zeroes at index 1 instead\nof index 0, as is necessary for arrays in Java. For example, numZero ([2, 7, 0]) cor-\nrectly evaluates to 1, while numZero ([0, 7, 2]) incorrectly evaluates to 0. In both\nof these cases the fault is executed. Although both of these cases result in an error,\nonly the second case results in failure. To understand the error states, we need to\nidentify the state for the program. The state for numZero consists of values for the\nvariables x, count, i, and the program counter (denoted PC). For the first example\ngiven above, the state at the if statement on the very first iteration of the loop is\n( x = [2, 7, 0], count = 0, i = 1, PC = if). Notice that this state is in error precisely be-\ncause the value of i should be zero on the first iteration. However, since the value of\ncount is coincidentally correct, the error state does not propagate to the output, and\nhence the software does not fail. In other words, a state is in error simply if it is not\nthe expected state, even if all of the values in the state, considered in isolation, are\nacceptable. More generally, if the required sequence of states is s0, s1, s2, . . . , and\nthe actual sequence of states is s0, s2, s3, . . . , then state s2 is in error in the second\nsequence.\n\nIn the second case the corresponding (error) state is (x = [0, 7, 2], count = 0, i =\n1, PC = if). In this case, the error propagates to the variable count and is present in\nthe return value of the method. Hence a failure results.\n\nThe definitions of fault and failure allow us to distinguish testing from debugg-\ning.\n\nDefinition 1.6 Testing: Evaluating software by observing its execution.\n\nDefinition 1.7 Test Failure: Execution that results in a failure.\n\nDefinition 1.8 Debugging: The process of finding a fault given a failure.\n\nOf course the central issue is that for a given fault, not all inputs will \u201ctrigger\u201d\nthe fault into creating incorrect output (a failure). Also, it is often very difficult to re-\nlate a failure to the associated fault. Analyzing these ideas leads to the fault/failure\nmodel, which states that three conditions must be present for a failure to be ob-\nserved.\n\n1. The location or locations in the program that contain the fault must be\nreached (Reachability).\n\n2. After executing the location, the state of the program must be incorrect\n(Infection).\n\n3. The infected state must propagate to cause some output of the program to be\nincorrect (Propagation).\n\nThis \u201cRIP\u201d model is very important for coverage criteria such as mutation (Chap-\nter 5) and for automatic test data generation. It is important to note that the RIP\nmodel applies even in the case of faults of omission. In particular, when execution\ntraverses the missing code, the program counter, which is part of the internal state,\nnecessarily has the wrong value.\n\nThe next definitions are less standardized and the literature varies widely. The\ndefinitions are our own but are consistent with common usage. A test engineer must\nrecognize that tests include more than just input values, but are actually multipart\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n14 Overview\n\nsoftware artifacts.

The structure of the text directly reflects the pedagogical approach\nand incorporates the latest innovations in testing, including modern types\nof software such as OO, Web applications, and embedded software. The\nbook contains numerous examples throughout. An instructor\u2019s solution\nmanual, PowerPoint slides, sample syllabi, additional examples and up-\ndates, testing tools for students, and example software programs in Java\nare available on an extensive Web site at www.introsoftwaretesting.com.\n\nPaul Ammann, PhD, is an Associate Professor of software engineer-\ning at George Mason University. He received an outstanding teaching\naward in 2007 from the Volgenau School of Information Technology and\nEngineering. Dr. Ammann earned an AB degree in computer science\nfrom Dartmouth College and MS and PhD degrees in computer science\nfrom the University of Virginia.\n\nJeff Offutt, PhD, is a Professor of software engineering at George\nMason University. He is editor-in-chief of the Journal of Software Testing,\nVerification and Reliability; chair of the steering committee for the IEEE\nInternational Conference on Software Testing, Verification, and Valida-\ntion; and on the editorial boards for several journals. He recived the\noutstanding teacher award from the Volgenau School of Information\nTechnology and Engineering in 2003. Dr. Offutt earned a BS degree in\nmathematics and data processing from Morehead State University and\nMS and PhD degrees in computer science from the Georgia Institute of\nTechnology.\n\ni\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nii\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nINTRODUCTION TO\nSOFTWARE\nTESTING\n\nPaul Ammann\nGeorge Mason University\n\nJeff Offutt\nGeorge Mason University\n\niii\n\n\n\nCAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS\n\nCambridge, New York, Melbourne, Madrid, Cape Town, Singapore, S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nCambridge University Press\nThe Edinburgh Building, Cambridge CB2 8RU, UK\n\nFirst published in print format\n\nISBN-13    978-0-521-88038-1\n\nISBN-13 978-0-511-39330-3\n\n\u00a9 Paul Ammann and Jeff Offutt 2008\n\n2008\n\nInformation on this title: www.cambridge.org/9780521880381\n\nThis publication is in copyright.

to\nproducing high-quality software. It is designed to be used as the primary textbook\nin either an undergraduate or graduate course on software testing, as a supplement\nto a general course on software engineering or data structures, and as a resource\nfor software test engineers and developers. This book has a number of unique\nfeatures:\n\n\ufffd It organizes the complex and confusing landscape of test coverage criteria with\na novel and extremely simple structure. At a technical level, software testing is\nbased on satisfying coverage criteria. The book\u2019s central observation is that there\nare few truly different coverage criteria, each of which fits easily into one of four\ncategories: graphs, logical expressions, input space, and syntax structures. This\nnot only simplifies testing, but it also allows a convenient and direct theoretical\ntreatment of each category. This approach contrasts strongly with the traditional\nview of testing, which treats testing at each phase in the development process\ndifferently.\n\n\ufffd It is designed and written to be a textbook. The writing style is direct, it builds the\nconcepts from the ground up with a minimum of required background, and it in-\ncludes lots of examples, homework problems, and teaching materials. It provides\na balance of theory and practical application, presenting testing as a collection\nof objective, quantitative activities that can be measured and repeated. The the-\noretical concepts are presented when needed to support the practical activities\nthat test engineers follow.\n\n\ufffd It assumes that testing is part of a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals\ndevelop higher-quality software. Testing is not an anti-engineering activity, and\nit is not an inherently destructive process. Neither is it only for testing specialists\nor domain experts who know little about programming or math.\n\n\ufffd It is designed with modular, interconnecting pieces; thus it can be used in multi-\nple courses. Most of the book requires only basic discrete math and introductory\nprogramming, and the parts that need more background are clearly marked.

The concepts in this book\nare well grounded in theory, are practical, and most are currently in use.\n\nWHY SHOULD THIS BOOK BE USED?\n\nNot very long ago, software development companies could afford to employ pro-\ngrammers who could not test and testers who could not program. For most of the\nindustry, it was not necessary for either group to know the technical principles be-\nhind software testing or even software development. Software testing in industry\nhistorically has been a nontechnical activity. Industry viewed testing primarily from\nthe managerial and process perspective and had limited expectations of practition-\ners\u2019 technical training.\n\nAs the software engineering profession matures, and as software becomes more\npervasive in everyday life, there are increasingly stringent requirements for software\nreliability, maintainability, and security. Industry must respond to these changes by,\namong other things, improving the way software is tested. This requires increased\ntechnical expertise on the part of test engineers, as well as increased emphasis on\ntesting by software developers. The good news is that the knowledge and technol-\nogy are available and based on over 30 years of research and practice. This book\nputs that knowledge into a form that students, test engineers, test managers, and\ndevelopers can access.\n\nAt the same time, it is relatively rare to find courses that teach testing in univer-\nsities. Only a few undergraduate courses exist, almost no masters degree programs\nin computer science or software engineering require a course in software testing,\nand only a few dozen have an elective course. Not only is testing not covered as an\nessential part of undergraduate computer science education, most computer science\nstudents either never gain any knowledge about testing, or see only a few lectures\nas part of a general course in software engineering.\n\nThe authors of this book have been teaching software testing to software en-\ngineering and computer science students for more than 15 years. Over that time\nwe somewhat reluctantly came to the conclusion that no one was going to write\nthe book we wanted to use. Rather, to get the book we wanted, we would have to\nwrite it.\n\nPrevious testing books have presented software testing as a relatively simple\nsubject that relies more on process than technical understanding of how software\nis constructed, as a complicated and fractured subject that requires detailed under-\nstanding of numerous software development technologies, or as a completely the-\noretical subject that can be mastered only by mathematicians and theoretical com-\nputer scientists. Most books on software testing are organized around the phases in\na typical software development lifecycle, an approach that has the unfortunate side\neffect of obscuring common testing themes. Finally, most testing books are written\nas reference books, not textbooks. As a result, only instructors with prior expertise\nin software testing can easily teach the subject. This book is accessible to instructors\nwho are not already testing experts.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nPreface xvii\n\nThis book differs from other books on software testing in other important ways.\nMany books address managing the testing process. While this is important, it is\nequally important to give testers specific techniques grounded in basic theory. This\nbook provides a balance of theory and practical application. This is important in-\nformation that software companies must have; however, this book focuses specif-\nically on the technical nuts-and-bolts issues of designing and creating tests. Other\ntesting books currently on the market focus on specific techniques or activities,\nsuch as system testing or unit testing. This book is intended to be comprehensive\nover the entire software development process and to cover as many techniques as\npossible.\n\nAs stated previously, the motivation for this book is to support courses in soft-\nware testing. Our first target was our own software testing course in our Soft-\nware Engineering MS program at George Mason University. This popular elective\nis taught to about 30 computer science and software engineering students every\nsemester. We also teach PhD seminars in software testing, industry short courses\non specialized aspects, and lectures on software testing in various undergraduate\ncourses. Although few undergraduate courses on software testing exist, we believe\nthat they should exist, and we expect they will in the near future. Most testing books\nare not designed for classroom use. We specifically wrote this book to support our\nclassroom activities, and it is no accident that the syllabus for our testing course,\navailable on the book\u2019s Web site (www.introsoftwaretesting.com), closely follows\nthe table of contents for this book.\n\nThis book includes numerous carefully worked examples to help students and\nteachers alike learn the sometimes complicated concepts. The instructor\u2019s resources\ninclude high-quality powerpoint slides, presentation hints, solutions to exercises,\nand working software. Our philosophy is that we are doing more than writing a\nbook; we are offering our course to the community. One of our goals was to write\nmaterial that is scholarly and true to the published research literature, but that is\nalso accessible to nonresearchers. Although the presentation in the book is quite a\nbit different from the research papers that the material is derived from, the essen-\ntial ideas are true to the literature. To make the text flow more smoothly, we have\nremoved the references from the presentation. For those interested in the research\ngenealogy, each chapter closes with a bibliographic notes section that summarizes\nwhere the concepts come from.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nStudents who read and use this book will learn the fundamental principles behind\nsoftware testing, and how to apply these principles to produce better software,\nfaster. They will not only become better programmers, they will also be prepared\nto carry out high-quality testing activities for their future employers. Instructors\nwill be able to use this book in the classroom, even without prior practical exper-\ntise in software testing. The numerous exercises and thought-provoking problems,\nclassroom-ready and classroom-tested slides, and suggested outside activities make\nthis material teachable by instructors who are not already experts in software test-\ning. Research students such as beginning PhD students will find this book to be an\ninvaluable resource as a starting point to the field. The theory is sound and clearly\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nxviii Preface\n\npresented, the practical applications reveal what is useful and what is not, and the\nadvanced reading and bibliographic notes provide pointers into the literature. Al-\nthough the set of research students in software testing is a relatively small audi-\nence, we believe it is a key audience, because a common, easily achievable baseline\nwould reduce the effort required for research students to join the community of\ntesting researchers. Researchers who are already familiar with the field will find the\ncriteria-approach to be novel and interesting. Some may disagree with the pedagog-\nical approach, but we have found that the view that testing is an application of only\na few criteria to a very few software structures to be very helpful to our research.\nWe hope that testing research in the future will draw away from searches for more\ncriteria to novel uses and evaluations of existing criteria.\n\nTesters in the industry will find this book to be an invaluable collection of tech-\nniques that will help improve their testing, no matter what their current process is.\nThe criteria presented here are intended to be used as a \u201ctoolbox\u201d of tricks that\ncan be used to find faults. Developers who read this book will find numerous ways\nto improve their own software. Their self-testing activities can become more effi-\ncient and effective, and the discussions of software faults that test engineers search\nfor will help developers avoid them. To paraphrase a famous parable, if you want\nto teach a person to be a better fisherman, explain how and where the fish swim.\nFinally, managers will find this book to be a useful explanation of how clever test\nengineers do their job, and of how test tools work. They will be able to make more\neffective decisions regarding hiring, promotions, and purchasing tools.\n\nHOW CAN THIS BOOK BE USED?\n\nA major advantage of the structure of this book is that it can be easily used for\nseveral different courses. Most of the book depends on material that is taught very\nearly in college and some high schools: basic concepts from data structures and dis-\ncrete math. The sections are organized so that the early material in each chapter\nis accessible to less advanced students, and material that requires more advanced\nknowledge is clearly marked.\n\nSpecifically, the book defines six separate sets of chapter sections that form\nstreams through the book:\n\n1. A module within a CS II course\n2. A sophomore-level course on software testing\n3. A module in a general software engineering course\n4. A senior-level course on software testing\n5. A first-year MS level course on software testing\n6. An advanced graduate research-oriented course on software testing\n7. Industry practioner relevant sections\nThe stream approach is illustrated in the abbreviated table of contents in\n\nthe figure shown on pp. xix\u2013xx. Each chapter section is marked with which stream\nit belongs too. Of course, individual instructors, students, and readers may prefer\nto adapt the stream to their own interests or purposes. We suggest that the first\ntwo sections of Chapter 1 and the first two sections of Chapter 6 are appropriate\nreading for a module in a data structures (CS II) class, to be followed by a simple\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nPreface xix\n\nStream 1: Module in a CS II course.\n\nStream 2: Sophomore-level course on software testing.\n\nStream 3: Module in a general software engineering course.\n\nStream 4: Senior-level course on software testing.\n\nStream 5: First-year MS course on software testing.\n\nStream 6: Advanced graduate research-oriented course on software testing.\n\nStream 7: Industry practitioner relevant sections\n\nSTREAMS\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nPart I: Overview\nChapter 1.

Our favorite is to ask the students to retrieve one of their previously\ngraded programs and satisfy some simple test criterion like branch coverage.

This includes sections in Chap-\nter 2 on data flow testing, sections that involve integration testing of multiple mod-\nules, and sections that rely on grammars or finite state machines. Most senior com-\nputer science students will have seen this material in their other courses. Most of the\nsections that appear in stream 4 but not stream 2 could be added to stream 2 with\nappropriate short introductions. It is important to note that a test engineer does not\nneed to know all the theory of parsing to use data flow testing or all the theory on\nfinite state machines to use statecharts for testing.\n\nThe graduate-level course on software testing (stream 5) adds some additional\nsections that rely on a broader context and that require more theoretical maturity.\nFor example, these sections use knowledge of elementary formal methods, polymor-\nphism, and some of the UML diagrams. Some of the more advanced topics and the\nentire chapter on building testing tools are also intended for a graduate audience.\nThis chapter could form the basis for a good project, for example, to implement a\nsimple coverage analyzer.\n\nAn advanced graduate course in software testing with a research emphasis such\nas a PhD seminar (stream 6) includes issues that are still unproven and research in\nnature. The bibliographic notes are recommended only for these students as indica-\ntors for future in-depth reading.\n\nFinally, sections that are reasonably widely used in industry, especially those\nthat have commercial tool support, are marked for stream 7. These sections have a\nminimum of theory and omit criteria that are still of questionable usefulness.\n\nExtensive supplementary materials, including sample syllabuses, PowerPoint\nslides, presentation hints, solutions to exercises, working software, and errata are\navailable on the book\u2019s companion Web site.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nMany people helped us write this book.

A software developer can expect to use the concepts pre-\nsented in this book many times during his or her career. This chapter introduces the\nsubject of software testing by describing the activities of a test engineer, defining a\nnumber of key terms, and then explaining the central notion of test coverage.\n\nSoftware is a key ingredient in many of the devices and systems that pervade\nour society. Software defines the behavior of network routers, financial networks,\ntelephone switching networks, the Web, and other infrastructure of modern life.\nSoftware is an essential component of embedded applications that control exotic\napplications such as airplanes, spaceships, and air traffic control systems, as well as\nmundane appliances such as watches, ovens, cars, DVD players, garage door open-\ners, cell phones, and remote controllers. Modern households have over 50 proces-\nsors, and some new cars have over 100; all of them running software that optimistic\nconsumers assume will never fail! Although many factors affect the engineering of\nreliable software, including, of course, careful design and sound process manage-\nment, testing is the primary method that the industry uses to evaluate software un-\nder development. Fortunately, a few basic software testing concepts can be used\nto design tests for a large variety of software applications. A goal of this book is\nto present these concepts in such a way that the student or practicing engineer can\neasily apply them to any software testing situation.\n\nThis textbook differs from other software testing books in several respects.\nThe most important difference is in how it views testing techniques. In his land-\nmark book Software Testing Techniques, Beizer wrote that testing is simple \u2013 all\na tester needs to do is \u201cfind a graph and cover it.\u201d Thanks to Beizer\u2019s insight, it\nbecame evident to us that the myriad testing techniques present in the literature\nhave much more in common than is obvious at first glance. Testing techniques typ-\nically are presented in the context of a particular software artifact (for example, a\nrequirements document or code) or a particular phase of the lifecycle (for exam-\nple, requirements analysis or implementation). Unfortunately, such a presentation\nobscures the underlying similarities between techniques. This book clarifies these\nsimilarities.\n\n3\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n4 Overview\n\nIt turns out that graphs do not characterize all testing techniques well; other\nabstract models are necessary. Much to our surprise, we have found that a small\nnumber of abstract models suffice: graphs, logical expressions, input domain char-\nacterizations, and syntactic descriptions. The main contribution of this book is to\nsimplify testing by classifying coverage criteria into these four categories, and this is\nwhy Part II of this book has exactly four chapters.\n\nThis book provides a balance of theory and practical application, thereby pre-\nsenting testing as a collection of objective, quantitative activities that can be mea-\nsured and repeated. The theory is based on the published literature, and presented\nwithout excessive formalism. Most importantly, the theoretical concepts are pre-\nsented when needed to support the practical activities that test engineers follow.\nThat is, this book is intended for software developers.\n\n1.1 ACTIVITIES OF A TEST ENGINEER\n\nIn this book, a test engineer is an information technology (IT) professional who is in\ncharge of one or more technical test activities, including designing test inputs, pro-\nducing test case values, running test scripts, analyzing results, and reporting results\nto developers and managers. Although we cast the description in terms of test engi-\nneers, every engineer involved in software development should realize that he or she\nsometimes wears the hat of a test engineer. The reason is that each software artifact\nproduced over the course of a product\u2019s development has, or should have, an asso-\nciated set of test cases, and the person best positioned to define these test cases is\noften the designer of the artifact. A test manager is in charge of one or more test en-\ngineers. Test managers set test policies and processes, interact with other managers\non the project, and otherwise help the engineers do their work.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows some of the major activities of test engineers. A test engi-\nneer must design tests by creating test requirements. These requirements are then\n\nTest\nEngineer\n\nTest\nDesigns\n\nExecutable\nTests\n\nComputer EvaluateP Output\n\nTest\nEngineer Test\n\nEngineer\n\ndesign instantiate\n\nexecute\n\n}\n\nTest\nManager\n\nFigure 1.1. Activities of test engineers.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 5\n\ntransformed into actual values and scripts that are ready for execution. These ex-\necutable tests are run against the software, denoted P in the figure, and the results\nare evaluated to determine if the tests reveal a fault in the software. These activities\nmay be carried out by one person or by several, and the process is monitored by a\ntest manager.\n\nOne of a test engineer\u2019s most powerful tools is a formal coverage criterion. For-\nmal coverage criteria give test engineers ways to decide what test inputs to use dur-\ning testing, making it more likely that the tester will find problems in the program\nand providing greater assurance that the software is of high quality and reliability.\nCoverage criteria also provide stopping rules for the test engineers. The technical\ncore of this book presents the coverage criteria that are available, describes how\nthey are supported by tools (commercial and otherwise), explains how they can best\nbe applied, and suggests how they can be integrated into the overall development\nprocess.\n\nSoftware testing activities have long been categorized into levels, and two kinds\nof levels have traditionally been used. The most often used level categorization is\nbased on traditional software process steps. Although most types of tests can only\nbe run after some part of the software is implemented, tests can be designed and\nconstructed during all software development steps. The most time-consuming parts\nof testing are actually the test design and construction, so test activities can and\nshould be carried out throughout development. The second-level categorization is\nbased on the attitude and thinking of the testers.\n\n1.1.1 Testing Levels Based on Software Activity\n\nTests can be derived from requirements and specifications, design artifacts, or the\nsource code. A different level of testing accompanies each distinct software devel-\nopment activity:\n\n\ufffd Acceptance Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to requirements.\n\ufffd System Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to architectural design.\n\ufffd Integration Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to subsystem design.\n\ufffd Module Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to detailed design.\n\ufffd Unit Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to implementation.\n\nFigure 1.2 illustrates a typical scenario for testing levels and how they relate to\nsoftware development activities by isolating each step. Information for each test\nlevel is typically derived from the associated development activity. Indeed, stan-\ndard advice is to design the tests concurrently with each development activity, even\nthough the software will not be in an executable form until the implementation\nphase. The reason for this advice is that the mere process of explicitly articulat-\ning tests can identify defects in design decisions that otherwise appear reasonable.\nEarly identification of defects is by far the best means of reducing their ultimate\ncost. Note that this diagram is not intended to imply a waterfall process. The syn-\nthesis and analysis activities generically apply to any development process.\n\nThe requirements analysis phase of software development captures the cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs. Acceptance testing is designed to determine whether the completed\nsoftware in fact meets these needs. In other words, acceptance testing probes\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n6 Overview\n\nRequirements\nAnalysis\n\nArchitectural\nDesign\n\nSubsystem\nDesign\n\nDetailed Design\n\nImplementation Unit\nTest\n\nModule\nTest\n\nSystem\nTest\n\nIntegration\nTest\n\nAcceptance\nTest\n\nTest\n\nDesign\n\nInformation\n\nFigure 1.2.

Acceptance testing must involve\nusers or other individuals who have strong domain knowledge.\n\nThe architectural design phase of software development chooses components\nand connectors that together realize a system whose specification is intended to\nmeet the previously identified requirements. System testing is designed to determine\nwhether the assembled system meets its specifications. It assumes that the pieces\nwork individually, and asks if the system works as a whole. This level of testing usu-\nally looks for design and specification problems. It is a very expensive place to find\nlower-level faults and is usually not done by the programmers, but by a separate\ntesting team.\n\nThe subsystem design phase of software development specifies the structure and\nbehavior of subsystems, each of which is intended to satisfy some function in the\noverall architecture. Often, the subsystems are adaptations of previously developed\nsoftware. Integration testing is designed to assess whether the interfaces between\nmodules (defined below) in a given subsystem have consistent assumptions and com-\nmunicate correctly. Integration testing must assume that modules work correctly.\nSome testing literature uses the terms integration testing and system testing inter-\nchangeably; in this book, integration testing does not refer to testing the integrated\nsystem or subsystem. Integration testing is usually the responsibility of members of\nthe development team.\n\nThe detailed design phase of software development determines the structure and\nbehavior of individual modules. A program unit, or procedure, is one or more con-\ntiguous program statements, with a name that other parts of the software use to\ncall it. Units are called functions in C and C++, procedures or functions in Ada,\nmethods in Java, and subroutines in Fortran. A module is a collection of related\nunits that are assembled in a file, package, or class. This corresponds to a file in\nC, a package in Ada, and a class in C++ and Java. Module testing is designed to\nassess individual modules in isolation, including how the component units interact\nwith each other and their associated data structures. Most software development\norganizations make module testing the responsibility of the programmer.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nImplementation is the phase of software development that actually produces\ncode. Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished. This turns out to be\na very simple fault to find during unit testing; indeed analysis showed that almost\nany unit level coverage criterion would have found this multimillion dollar mistake.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n8 Overview\n\nThe Pentium bug not only illustrates the difference in testing levels, but it is also\none of the best arguments for paying more attention to unit testing. There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nThis model does not distinguish between a program\u2019s incorrect behavior and a mis-\ntake within the program, and does very little to help develop software that is reliable\nor safe.\n\nIn Level 1 testing, the purpose is to show correctness. While a significant step up\nfrom the naive level 0, this has the unfortunate problem that in any but the most triv-\nial of programs, correctness is virtually impossible to either achieve or demonstrate.\nSuppose we run a collection of tests and find no failures. What do we know? Should\nwe assume that we have good software or just bad tests? Since the goal of correct-\nness is impossible, test engineers usually have no strict goal, real stopping rule, or\nformal test technique. If a development manager asks how much testing remains to\nbe done, the test manager has no way to answer the question. In fact, test managers\nare in a powerless position because they have no way to quantitatively express or\nevaluate their work.\n\nIn Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures. Although looking for failures\nis certainly a valid goal, it is also a negative goal. Testers may enjoy finding the\nproblem, but the developers never want to find problems \u2013 they want the software\nto work (level 1 thinking is natural for the developers). Thus, level 2 testing puts\ntesters and developers into an adversarial relationship, which can be bad for team\nmorale. Beyond that, when our primary goal is to look for failures, we are still left\nwondering what to do if no failures are found. Is our work done? Is our software\nvery good, or is the testing weak? Having confidence in when testing is complete is\nan important goal for all testers.\n\nThe thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing\ncan show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. This lets us accept the fact\nthat whenever we use software, we incur some risk. The risk may be small and the\nconsequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catas-\ntrophic, but risk is always there. This allows us to realize that the entire develop-\nment team wants the same thing \u2013 to reduce the risk of using the software. In level 3\ntesting, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.\n\nOnce the testers and developers are on the same \u201cteam,\u201d an organization can\nprogress to real Level 4 testing. Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental disci-\npline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating\ntests that cause the software to fail is only one. Adopting this mindset, test engi-\nneers can become the technical leaders of the project (as is common in many other\nengineering disciplines). They have the primary responsibility of measuring and im-\nproving software quality, and their expertise should help the developers. An analogy\nthat Beizer used is that of a spell checker. We often think that the purpose of a spell\nchecker is to find misspelled words, but in fact, the best purpose of a spell checker\nis to improve our ability to spell. Every time the spell checker finds an incorrectly\nspelled word, we have the opportunity to learn how to spell the word correctly. The\nspell checker is the \u201cexpert\u201d on spelling quality. In the same way, level 4 testing\nmeans that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to pro-\nduce high quality software. The testers should train your developers.\n\nAs a reader of this book, you probably start at level 0, 1, or 2. Most software\ndevelopers go through these levels at some stage in their careers. If you work in\nsoftware development, you might pause to reflect on which testing level describes\nyour company or team. The rest of this chapter should help you move to level 2\nthinking, and to understand the importance of level 3. Subsequent chapters will give\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n10 Overview\n\nyou the knowledge, skills, and tools to be able to work at level 3. The ultimate goal\nof this book is to provide a philosophical basis that will allow readers to become\n\u201cchange agents\u201d in their organizations for level 4 thinking, and test engineers to\nbecome software quality experts.\n\n1.1.3 Automation of Test Activities\n\nSoftware testing is expensive and labor intensive. Software testing requires up to\n50% of software development costs, and even more for safety-critical applications.\nOne of the goals of software testing is to automate as much as possible, thereby signi-\nficantly reducing its cost, minimizing human error, and making regression testing\neasier.\n\nSoftware engineers sometimes distinguish revenue tasks, which contribute di-\nrectly to the solution of a problem, from excise tasks, which do not. For example,\ncompiling a Java class is a classic excise task because, although necessary for the\nclass to become executable, compilation contributes nothing to the particular behav-\nior of that class. In contrast, determining which methods are appropriate to define a\ngiven data abstraction as a Java class is a revenue task. Excise tasks are candidates\nfor automation; revenue tasks are not. Software testing probably has more excise\ntasks than any other aspect of software development. Maintaining test scripts, re-\nrunning tests, and comparing expected results with actual results are all common\nexcise tasks that routinely consume large chunks of test engineer\u2019s time. Automat-\ning excise tasks serves the test engineer in many ways. First, eliminating excise tasks\neliminates drudgery, thereby making the test engineers job more satisfying. Second,\nautomation frees up time to focus on the fun and challenging parts of testing, namely\nthe revenue tasks. Third, automation can help eliminate errors of omission, such as\nfailing to update all the relevant files with the new set of expected results. Fourth,\nautomation eliminates some of the variance in test quality caused by differences in\nindividual\u2019s abilities.\n\nMany testing tasks that defied automation in the past are now candidates for such\ntreatment due to advances in technology. For example, generating test cases that\nsatisfy given test requirements is typically a hard problem that requires intervention\nfrom the test engineer. However, there are tools, both research and commercial,\nthat automate this task to varying degrees.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.1.\n\n1.

The following exercise is intended to encourage you to think of testing in a\nmore rigorous way than you may be used to. The exercise also hints at the\nstrong relationship between specification clarity, faults, and test cases.1\n\n(a) Write a Java method with the signature\npublic static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)\n\nThe method should return a Vector of objects that are in either of the\ntwo argument Vectors.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 11\n\n(b) Upon reflection, you may discover a variety of defects and ambiguities\nin the given assignment.

You might wish to illustrate your spec-\nification with examples drawn from your test cases.\n\n1.2 SOFTWARE TESTING LIMITATIONS AND TERMINOLOGY\n\nAs said in the previous section, one of the most important limitations of software\ntesting is that testing can show only the presence of failures, not their absence. This\nis a fundamental, theoretical limitation; generally speaking, the problem of finding\nall failures in a program is undecidable. Testers often call a successful (or effective)\ntest one that finds an error. While this is an example of level 2 thinking, it is also a\ncharacterization that is often useful and that we will use later in this book.\n\nThe rest of this section presents a number of terms that are important in software\ntesting and that will be used later in this book. Most of these are taken from stan-\ndards documents, and although the phrasing is ours, we try to be consistent with the\nstandards. Useful standards for reading in more detail are the IEEE Standard Glos-\nsary of Software Engineering Terminology, DOD-STD-2167A and MIL-STD-498\nfrom the US Department of Defense, and the British Computer Society\u2019s Standard\nfor Software Component Testing.\n\nOne of the most important distinctions to make is between validation and verifi-\ncation.\n\nDefinition 1.1 Validation: The process of evaluating software at the end of\nsoftware development to ensure compliance with intended usage.\n\nDefinition 1.2 Verification: The process of determining whether the products\nof a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements\nestablished during the previous phase.\n\nVerification is usually a more technical activity that uses knowledge about the\nindividual software artifacts, requirements, and specifications. Validation usually\ndepends on domain knowledge; that is, knowledge of the application for which the\nsoftware is written. For example, validation of software for an airplane requires\nknowledge from aerospace engineers and pilots.\n\nThe acronym \u201cIV&V\u201d stands for \u201cindependent verification and validation,\u201d\nwhere \u201cindependent\u201d means that the evaluation is done by nondevelopers. Some-\ntimes the IV&V team is within the same project, sometimes the same company, and\nsometimes it is entirely an external entity. In part because of the independent nature\nof IV&V, the process often is not started until the software is complete and is often\ndone by people whose expertise is in the application domain rather than software\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n12 Overview\n\ndevelopment. This can sometimes mean that validation is given more weight than\nverification.\n\nTwo terms that we have already used are fault and failure. Understanding this dis-\ntinction is the first step in moving from level 0 thinking to level 1 thinking. We adopt\nthe definition of software fault, error, and failure from the dependability community.\n\nDefinition 1.3 Software Fault: A static defect in the software.\n\nDefinition 1.4 Software Error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifes-\ntation of some fault.\n\nDefinition 1.5 Software Failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to\nthe requirements or other description of the expected behavior.\n\nConsider a medical doctor making a diagnosis for a patient. The patient enters\nthe doctor\u2019s office with a list of failures (that is, symptoms). The doctor then must\ndiscover the fault, or root cause of the symptom. To aid in the diagnosis, a doctor\nmay order tests that look for anomalous internal conditions, such as high blood\npressure, an irregular heartbeat, high levels of blood glucose, or high cholesterol. In\nour terminology, these anomalous internal conditions correspond to errors.\n\nWhile this analogy may help the student clarify his or her thinking about faults,\nerrors, and failures, software testing and a doctor\u2019s diagnosis differ in one crucial\nway. Specifically, faults in software are design mistakes. They do not appear spon-\ntaneously, but rather exist as a result of some (unfortunate) decision by a human.\nMedical problems (as well as faults in computer system hardware), on the other\nhand, are often a result of physical degradation. This distinction is important be-\ncause it explains the limits on the extent to which any process can hope to control\nsoftware faults. Specifically, since no foolproof way exists to catch arbitrary mis-\ntakes made by humans, we cannot eliminate all faults from software. In colloquial\nterms, we can make software development foolproof, but we cannot, and should not\nattempt to, make it damn-foolproof.\n\nFor a more technical example of the definitions of fault, error, and failure, con-\nsider the following Java method:\n\npublic static int numZero (int[] x) {\n// Effects: if x == null throw NullPointerException\n// else return the number of occurrences of 0 in x\nint count = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length; i++)\n{\n\nif (x[i] == 0)\n{\n\ncount++;\n}\n\n}\nreturn count;\n\n}\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nThe fault in this program is that it starts looking for zeroes at index 1 instead\nof index 0, as is necessary for arrays in Java. For example, numZero ([2, 7, 0]) cor-\nrectly evaluates to 1, while numZero ([0, 7, 2]) incorrectly evaluates to 0. In both\nof these cases the fault is executed. Although both of these cases result in an error,\nonly the second case results in failure. To understand the error states, we need to\nidentify the state for the program. The state for numZero consists of values for the\nvariables x, count, i, and the program counter (denoted PC). For the first example\ngiven above, the state at the if statement on the very first iteration of the loop is\n( x = [2, 7, 0], count = 0, i = 1, PC = if). Notice that this state is in error precisely be-\ncause the value of i should be zero on the first iteration. However, since the value of\ncount is coincidentally correct, the error state does not propagate to the output, and\nhence the software does not fail. In other words, a state is in error simply if it is not\nthe expected state, even if all of the values in the state, considered in isolation, are\nacceptable. More generally, if the required sequence of states is s0, s1, s2, . . . , and\nthe actual sequence of states is s0, s2, s3, . . . , then state s2 is in error in the second\nsequence.\n\nIn the second case the corresponding (error) state is (x = [0, 7, 2], count = 0, i =\n1, PC = if). In this case, the error propagates to the variable count and is present in\nthe return value of the method. Hence a failure results.\n\nThe definitions of fault and failure allow us to distinguish testing from debugg-\ning.\n\nDefinition 1.6 Testing: Evaluating software by observing its execution.\n\nDefinition 1.7 Test Failure: Execution that results in a failure.\n\nDefinition 1.8 Debugging: The process of finding a fault given a failure.\n\nOf course the central issue is that for a given fault, not all inputs will \u201ctrigger\u201d\nthe fault into creating incorrect output (a failure). Also, it is often very difficult to re-\nlate a failure to the associated fault. Analyzing these ideas leads to the fault/failure\nmodel, which states that three conditions must be present for a failure to be ob-\nserved.\n\n1. The location or locations in the program that contain the fault must be\nreached (Reachability).\n\n2. After executing the location, the state of the program must be incorrect\n(Infection).\n\n3. The infected state must propagate to cause some output of the program to be\nincorrect (Propagation).\n\nThis \u201cRIP\u201d model is very important for coverage criteria such as mutation (Chap-\nter 5) and for automatic test data generation. It is important to note that the RIP\nmodel applies even in the case of faults of omission. In particular, when execution\ntraverses the missing code, the program counter, which is part of the internal state,\nnecessarily has the wrong value.\n\nThe next definitions are less standardized and the literature varies widely. The\ndefinitions are our own but are consistent with common usage. A test engineer must\nrecognize that tests include more than just input values, but are actually multipart\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n14 Overview\n\nsoftware artifacts. The piece of a test case that is referred to the most often is what\nwe call the test case value.\n\nDefinition 1.9 Test Case Values: The input values necessary to complete\nsome execution of the software under test.\n\nNote that the definition of test case values is quite broad. In a traditional batch\nenvironment, the definition is extremely clear. In a Web application, a complete\nexecution might be as small as the generation of part of a simple Web page, or it\nmight be as complex as the completion of a set of commercial transactions. In a\nreal-time system such as an avionics application, a complete execution might be a\nsingle frame, or it might be an entire flight.\n\nTest case values are the inputs to the program that test engineers typically focus\non during testing. They really define what sort of testing we will achieve. However,\ntest case values are not enough. In addition to test case values, other inputs are often\nneeded to run a test. These inputs may depend on the source of the tests, and may be\ncommands, user inputs, or a software method to call with values for its parameters.\nIn order to evaluate the results of a test, we must know what output a correct version\nof the program would produce for that test.\n\nDefinition 1.10 Expected Results: The result that will be produced when exe-\ncuting the test if and only if the program satisfies its intended behavior.\n\nTwo common practical problems associated with software testing are how to\nprovide the right values to the software and observing details of the software\u2019s be-\nhavior. These two ideas are used to refine the definition of a test case.\n\nDefinition 1.11 Software Observability: How easy it is to observe the behav-\nior of a program in terms of its outputs, effects on the environment, and other\nhardware and software components.\n\nDefinition 1.12 Software Controllability: How easy it is to provide a program\nwith the needed inputs, in terms of values, operations, and behaviors.\n\nThese ideas are easily illustrated in the context of embedded software. Embed-\nded software often does not produce output for human consumption, but affects the\nbehavior of some piece of hardware. Thus, observability will be quite low. Likewise,\nsoftware for which all inputs are values entered from a keyboard is easy to control.\nBut an embedded program that gets its inputs from hardware sensors is more diffi-\ncult to control and some inputs may be difficult, dangerous or impossible to supply\n(for example, how does the automatic pilot behave when a train jumps off-track).\nMany observability and controllability problems can be addressed with simulation,\nby extra software built to \u201cbypass\u201d the hardware or software components that in-\nterfere with testing. Other applications that sometimes have low observability and\ncontrollability include component-based software, distributed software and Web\napplications.\n\nDepending on the software, the level of testing, and the source of the tests, the\ntester may need to supply other inputs to the software to affect controllability or\nobservability. For example, if we are testing software for a mobile telephone, the\ntest case values may be long distance phone numbers. We may also need to turn the\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nphone on to put it in the appropriate state and then we may need to press \u201ctalk\u201d\nand \u201cend\u201d buttons to view the results of the test case values and terminate the test.\nThese ideas are formalized as follows.\n\nDefinition 1.13 Prefix Values: Any inputs necessary to put the software into\nthe appropriate state to receive the test case values.\n\nDefinition 1.14 Postfix Values: Any inputs that need to be sent to the soft-\nware after the test case values are sent.\n\nPostfix values can be subdivided into two types.\n\nDefinition 1.15 Verification Values: Values necessary to see the results of the\ntest case values.\n\nDefinition 1.16 Exit Commands: Values needed to terminate the program or\notherwise return it to a stable state.\n\nA test case is the combination of all these components (test case values, expected\nresults, prefix values, and postfix values). When it is clear from context, however, we\nwill follow tradition and use the term \u201ctest case\u201d in place of \u201ctest case values.\u201d\n\nDefinition 1.17 Test Case: A test case is composed of the test case values,\nexpected results, prefix values, and postfix values necessary for a complete\nexecution and evaluation of the software under test.\n\nWe provide an explicit definition for a test set to emphasize that coverage is a\nproperty of a set of test cases, rather than a property of a single test case.\n\nDefinition 1.18 Test Set: A test set is simply a set of test cases.\n\nFinally, wise test engineers automate as many test activities as possible. A cru-\ncial way to automate testing is to prepare the test inputs as executable tests for the\nsoftware. This may be done as Unix shell scripts, input files, or through the use of\na tool that can control the software or software component being tested. Ideally,\nthe execution should be complete in the sense of running the software with the test\ncase values, getting the results, comparing the results with the expected results, and\npreparing a clear report for the test engineer.\n\nDefinition 1.19 Executable Test Script: A test case that is prepared in a form\nto be executed automatically on the test software and produce a report.\n\nThe only time a test engineer would not want to automate is if the cost of au-\ntomation outweighs the benefits. For example, this may happen if we are sure the\ntest will only be used once or if the automation requires knowledge or skills that the\ntest engineer does not have.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.2.\n\n1.

Specifically, the number of poten-\ntial inputs for most programs is so large as to be effectively infinite. Consider a\nJava compiler \u2013 the number of potential inputs to the compiler is not just all Java\nprograms, or even all almost correct Java programs, but all strings. The only limita-\ntion is the size of the file that can be read by the parser. Therefore, the number of\ninputs is effectively infinite and cannot be explicitly enumerated.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nThis is where formal coverage criteria come in. Since we cannot test with all in-\nputs, coverage criteria are used to decide which test inputs to use. The software test-\ning community believes that effective use of coverage criteria makes it more likely\nthat test engineers will find faults in a program and provides informal assurance that\nthe software is of high quality and reliability. While this is, perhaps, more an article\nof faith than a scientifically supported proposition, it is, in our view, the best option\ncurrently available. From a practical perspective, coverage criteria provide useful\nrules for when to stop testing.\n\nThis book defines coverage criteria in terms of test requirements. The basic idea\nis that we want our set of test cases to have various properties, each of which is\nprovided (or not) by an individual test case.2\n\nDefinition 1.20 Test Requirement: A test requirement is a specific element of\na software artifact that a test case must satisfy or cover.\n\nTest requirements usually come in sets, and we use the abbreviation TR to de-\nnote a set of test requirements.\n\nTest requirements can be described with respect to a variety of software artifacts,\nincluding the source code, design components, specification modeling elements, or\neven descriptions of the input space. Later in this book, test requirements will be\ngenerated from all of these.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a non-software example. Suppose we are given the enviable\ntask of testing bags of jelly beans. We need to come up with ways to sample from\nthe bags. Suppose these jelly beans have the following six flavors and come in four\ncolors: Lemon (colored Yellow), Pistachio (Green), Cantaloupe (Orange), Pear\n(White), Tangerine (also Orange), and Apricot (also Yellow). A simple approach to\ntesting might be to test one jelly bean of each flavor. Then we have six test require-\nments, one for each flavor. We satisfy the test requirement \u201cLemon\u201d by selecting\nand, of course, tasting a Lemon jelly bean from a bag of jelly beans. The reader\nmight wish to ponder how to decide, prior to the tasting step, if a given Yellow jelly\nbean is Lemon or Apricot. This dilemma illustrates a classic controllability issue.\n\nAs a more software-oriented example, if the goal is to cover all decisions in the\nprogram (branch coverage), then each decision leads to two test requirements, one\nfor the decision to evaluate to false, and one for the decision to evaluate to true. If\nevery method must be called at least once (call coverage), each method leads to one\ntest requirement.\n\nA coverage criterion is simply a recipe for generating test requirements in a sys-\ntematic way:\n\nDefinition 1.21 Coverage Criterion: A coverage criterion is a rule or collec-\ntion of rules that impose test requirements on a test set.\n\nThat is, the criterion describes the test requirements in a complete and unam-\nbiguous manner. The \u201cflavor criterion\u201d yields a simple strategy for selecting jelly\nbeans. In this case, the set of test requirements, TR, can be formally written out as\n\nTR = {flavor = Lemon, flavor = Pistachio, flavor = Cantaloupe,\nflavor = Pear, flavor = Tangerine, flavor = Apricot}\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n18 Overview\n\nTest engineers need to know how good a collection of tests is, so we measure\ntest sets against a criterion in terms of coverage.\n\nDefinition 1.22 Coverage: Given a set of test requirements TR for a coverage\ncriterion C, a test set T satisfies C if and only if for every test requirement tr\nin TR, at least one test t in T exists such that t satisfies tr .\n\nTo continue the example, a test set T with 12 beans: three Lemon, one Pistachio,\ntwo Cantaloupe, one Pear, one Tangerine, and four Apricot satisfies the \u201cflavor\ncriterion.\u201d Notice that it is perfectly acceptable to satisfy a given test requirement\nwith more than one test.\n\nCoverage is important for two reasons. First, it is sometimes expensive to sat-\nisfy a coverage criterion, so we want to compromise by trying to achieve a certain\ncoverage level.\n\nDefinition 1.23 Coverage Level: Given a set of test requirements TR and a\ntest set T, the coverage level is simply the ratio of the number of test require-\nments satisfied by T to the size of TR.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, some requirements cannot be satisfied. Suppose\nTangerine jelly beans are rare, some bags may not contain any, or it may simply\nbe too difficult to find a Tangerine bean. In this case, the flavor criterion cannot\nbe 100% satisfied, and the maximum coverage level possible is 5/6 or 83%. It often\nmakes sense to drop unsatisfiable test requirements from the set TR \u2013 or to replace\nthem with less stringent test requirements.\n\nTest requirements that cannot be satisfied are called infeasible. Formally, no test\ncase values exist that meet the test requirements. Examples for specific software\ncriteria will be shown throughout the book, but some may already be familiar.\nDead code results in infeasible test requirements because the statements cannot be\nreached. The detection of infeasible test requirements is formally undecidable for\nmost coverage criteria, and even though some researchers have tried to find partial\nsolutions, they have had only limited success. Thus, 100% coverage is impossible in\npractice.\n\nCoverage criteria are traditionally used in one of two ways. One method is to\ndirectly generate test case values to satisfy a given criterion. This method is often\nassumed by the research community and is the most obvious way to use criteria. It is\nalso very hard in some cases, particularly if we do not have enough automated tools\nto support test case value generation. The other method is to generate test case\nvalues externally (by hand or using a pseudo-random tool, for example) and then\nmeasure the tests against the criterion in terms of their coverage. This method is\nusually favored by industry practitioners, because generating tests to directly satisfy\nthe criterion is too hard. Unfortunately, this use is sometimes misleading. If our\ntests do not reach 100% coverage, what does that mean? We really have no data on\nhow much, say, 99% coverage is worse than 100% coverage, or 90%, or even 75%.\nBecause of this use of the criteria to evaluate existing test sets, coverage criteria are\nsometimes called metrics.\n\nThis distinction actually has a strong theoretical basis. A generator is a proce-\ndure that automatically generates values to satisfy a criterion, and a recognizer is a\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nprocedure that decides whether a given set of test case values satisfies a criterion.\nTheoretically, both problems are provably undecidable in the general case for most\ncriteria. In practice, however, it is possible to recognize whether test cases satisfy\na criterion far more often than it is possible to generate tests that satisfy the cri-\nterion. The primary problem with recognition is infeasible test requirements; if no\ninfeasible test requirements are present then the problem becomes decidable.\n\nIn practical terms of commercial automated test tools, a generator corresponds\nto a tool that automatically creates test case values. A recognizer is a coverage anal-\nysis tool. Coverage analysis tools are quite plentiful, both as commercial products\nand freeware.\n\nIt is important to appreciate that the set TR depends on the specific artifact\nunder test. In the jelly bean example, the test requirement color = Purple doesn\u2019t\nmake sense because we assumed that the factory does not make Purple jelly beans.\nIn the software context, consider statement coverage. The test requirement \u201cExe-\ncute statement 42\u201d makes sense only if the program under test does indeed have a\nstatement 42. A good way to think of this issue is that the test engineer starts with a\ngiven software artifact and then chooses a particular coverage criterion. Combining\nthe artifact with the criterion yields the specific set TR that is relevant to the test\nengineer\u2019s task.\n\nCoverage criteria are often related to one another, and compared in terms of\nsubsumption. Recall that the \u201cflavor criterion\u201d requires that every flavor be tried\nonce. We could also define a \u201ccolor criterion,\u201d which requires that we try one jelly\nbean of each color {yellow, green, orange, white}. If we satisfy the flavor criterion,\nthen we have also implicitly satisfied the color criterion. This is the essence of sub-\nsumption; that satisfying one criterion will guarantee that another one is satisfied.\n\nDefinition 1.24 Criteria Subsumption: A coverage criterion C1 subsumes C2\n\nif and only if every test set that satisfies criterion C1 also satisfies C2.\n\nNote that this has to be true for every test set, not just some sets. Subsump-\ntion has a strong similarity with set subset relationships, but it is not exactly the\nsame. Generally, a criterion C1 can subsume another C2 in one of two ways. The\nsimpler way is if the test requirements for C1 always form a superset of the re-\nquirements for C2. For example, another jelly bean criterion may be to try all fla-\nvors whose name begins with the letter \u2018C\u2019. This would result in the test require-\nments {Cantaloupe}, which is a subset of the requirements for the flavor criterion:\n{Lemon, Pistachio, Cantaloupe, Pear, Tangerine, Apricot}. Thus, the flavor criterion\nsubsumes the \u201cstarts-with-C\u201d criterion.\n\nThe relationship between the flavor and the color criteria illustrate the other\nway that subsumption can be shown. Since every flavor has a specific color, and ev-\nery color is represented by at least one flavor, if we satisfy the flavor criterion we will\nalso satisfy the color criterion. Formally, a many-to-one mapping exists between the\nrequirements for the flavor criterion and the requirements for the color criterion.\nThus, the flavor criterion subsumes the color criterion.

to\nproducing high-quality software. It is designed to be used as the primary textbook\nin either an undergraduate or graduate course on software testing, as a supplement\nto a general course on software engineering or data structures, and as a resource\nfor software test engineers and developers. This book has a number of unique\nfeatures:\n\n\ufffd It organizes the complex and confusing landscape of test coverage criteria with\na novel and extremely simple structure. At a technical level, software testing is\nbased on satisfying coverage criteria. The book\u2019s central observation is that there\nare few truly different coverage criteria, each of which fits easily into one of four\ncategories: graphs, logical expressions, input space, and syntax structures. This\nnot only simplifies testing, but it also allows a convenient and direct theoretical\ntreatment of each category. This approach contrasts strongly with the traditional\nview of testing, which treats testing at each phase in the development process\ndifferently.\n\n\ufffd It is designed and written to be a textbook. The writing style is direct, it builds the\nconcepts from the ground up with a minimum of required background, and it in-\ncludes lots of examples, homework problems, and teaching materials. It provides\na balance of theory and practical application, presenting testing as a collection\nof objective, quantitative activities that can be measured and repeated. The the-\noretical concepts are presented when needed to support the practical activities\nthat test engineers follow.\n\n\ufffd It assumes that testing is part of a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals\ndevelop higher-quality software. Testing is not an anti-engineering activity, and\nit is not an inherently destructive process. Neither is it only for testing specialists\nor domain experts who know little about programming or math.\n\n\ufffd It is designed with modular, interconnecting pieces; thus it can be used in multi-\nple courses. Most of the book requires only basic discrete math and introductory\nprogramming, and the parts that need more background are clearly marked. By\n\nxv\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nxvi Preface\n\nusing the appropriate sections, this book can support several classes, as described\nlater in the preface.\n\n\ufffd It assumes the reader is learning to be an engineer whose goal is to produce the\nbest possible software with the lowest possible cost. The concepts in this book\nare well grounded in theory, are practical, and most are currently in use.\n\nWHY SHOULD THIS BOOK BE USED?\n\nNot very long ago, software development companies could afford to employ pro-\ngrammers who could not test and testers who could not program. For most of the\nindustry, it was not necessary for either group to know the technical principles be-\nhind software testing or even software development. Software testing in industry\nhistorically has been a nontechnical activity. Industry viewed testing primarily from\nthe managerial and process perspective and had limited expectations of practition-\ners\u2019 technical training.\n\nAs the software engineering profession matures, and as software becomes more\npervasive in everyday life, there are increasingly stringent requirements for software\nreliability, maintainability, and security. Industry must respond to these changes by,\namong other things, improving the way software is tested. This requires increased\ntechnical expertise on the part of test engineers, as well as increased emphasis on\ntesting by software developers. The good news is that the knowledge and technol-\nogy are available and based on over 30 years of research and practice. This book\nputs that knowledge into a form that students, test engineers, test managers, and\ndevelopers can access.\n\nAt the same time, it is relatively rare to find courses that teach testing in univer-\nsities. Only a few undergraduate courses exist, almost no masters degree programs\nin computer science or software engineering require a course in software testing,\nand only a few dozen have an elective course. Not only is testing not covered as an\nessential part of undergraduate computer science education, most computer science\nstudents either never gain any knowledge about testing, or see only a few lectures\nas part of a general course in software engineering.\n\nThe authors of this book have been teaching software testing to software en-\ngineering and computer science students for more than 15 years. Over that time\nwe somewhat reluctantly came to the conclusion that no one was going to write\nthe book we wanted to use. Rather, to get the book we wanted, we would have to\nwrite it.\n\nPrevious testing books have presented software testing as a relatively simple\nsubject that relies more on process than technical understanding of how software\nis constructed, as a complicated and fractured subject that requires detailed under-\nstanding of numerous software development technologies, or as a completely the-\noretical subject that can be mastered only by mathematicians and theoretical com-\nputer scientists. Most books on software testing are organized around the phases in\na typical software development lifecycle, an approach that has the unfortunate side\neffect of obscuring common testing themes. Finally, most testing books are written\nas reference books, not textbooks. As a result, only instructors with prior expertise\nin software testing can easily teach the subject. This book is accessible to instructors\nwho are not already testing experts.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nPreface xvii\n\nThis book differs from other books on software testing in other important ways.\nMany books address managing the testing process. While this is important, it is\nequally important to give testers specific techniques grounded in basic theory. This\nbook provides a balance of theory and practical application. This is important in-\nformation that software companies must have; however, this book focuses specif-\nically on the technical nuts-and-bolts issues of designing and creating tests. Other\ntesting books currently on the market focus on specific techniques or activities,\nsuch as system testing or unit testing. This book is intended to be comprehensive\nover the entire software development process and to cover as many techniques as\npossible.\n\nAs stated previously, the motivation for this book is to support courses in soft-\nware testing. Our first target was our own software testing course in our Soft-\nware Engineering MS program at George Mason University. This popular elective\nis taught to about 30 computer science and software engineering students every\nsemester. We also teach PhD seminars in software testing, industry short courses\non specialized aspects, and lectures on software testing in various undergraduate\ncourses. Although few undergraduate courses on software testing exist, we believe\nthat they should exist, and we expect they will in the near future. Most testing books\nare not designed for classroom use. We specifically wrote this book to support our\nclassroom activities, and it is no accident that the syllabus for our testing course,\navailable on the book\u2019s Web site (www.introsoftwaretesting.com), closely follows\nthe table of contents for this book.\n\nThis book includes numerous carefully worked examples to help students and\nteachers alike learn the sometimes complicated concepts. The instructor\u2019s resources\ninclude high-quality powerpoint slides, presentation hints, solutions to exercises,\nand working software. Our philosophy is that we are doing more than writing a\nbook; we are offering our course to the community. One of our goals was to write\nmaterial that is scholarly and true to the published research literature, but that is\nalso accessible to nonresearchers. Although the presentation in the book is quite a\nbit different from the research papers that the material is derived from, the essen-\ntial ideas are true to the literature. To make the text flow more smoothly, we have\nremoved the references from the presentation. For those interested in the research\ngenealogy, each chapter closes with a bibliographic notes section that summarizes\nwhere the concepts come from.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nStudents who read and use this book will learn the fundamental principles behind\nsoftware testing, and how to apply these principles to produce better software,\nfaster. They will not only become better programmers, they will also be prepared\nto carry out high-quality testing activities for their future employers. Instructors\nwill be able to use this book in the classroom, even without prior practical exper-\ntise in software testing. The numerous exercises and thought-provoking problems,\nclassroom-ready and classroom-tested slides, and suggested outside activities make\nthis material teachable by instructors who are not already experts in software test-\ning. Research students such as beginning PhD students will find this book to be an\ninvaluable resource as a starting point to the field. The theory is sound and clearly\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nxviii Preface\n\npresented, the practical applications reveal what is useful and what is not, and the\nadvanced reading and bibliographic notes provide pointers into the literature. Al-\nthough the set of research students in software testing is a relatively small audi-\nence, we believe it is a key audience, because a common, easily achievable baseline\nwould reduce the effort required for research students to join the community of\ntesting researchers. Researchers who are already familiar with the field will find the\ncriteria-approach to be novel and interesting. Some may disagree with the pedagog-\nical approach, but we have found that the view that testing is an application of only\na few criteria to a very few software structures to be very helpful to our research.\nWe hope that testing research in the future will draw away from searches for more\ncriteria to novel uses and evaluations of existing criteria.\n\nTesters in the industry will find this book to be an invaluable collection of tech-\nniques that will help improve their testing, no matter what their current process is.\nThe criteria presented here are intended to be used as a \u201ctoolbox\u201d of tricks that\ncan be used to find faults. Developers who read this book will find numerous ways\nto improve their own software. Their self-testing activities can become more effi-\ncient and effective, and the discussions of software faults that test engineers search\nfor will help developers avoid them. To paraphrase a famous parable, if you want\nto teach a person to be a better fisherman, explain how and where the fish swim.\nFinally, managers will find this book to be a useful explanation of how clever test\nengineers do their job, and of how test tools work. They will be able to make more\neffective decisions regarding hiring, promotions, and purchasing tools.\n\nHOW CAN THIS BOOK BE USED?\n\nA major advantage of the structure of this book is that it can be easily used for\nseveral different courses. Most of the book depends on material that is taught very\nearly in college and some high schools: basic concepts from data structures and dis-\ncrete math. The sections are organized so that the early material in each chapter\nis accessible to less advanced students, and material that requires more advanced\nknowledge is clearly marked.\n\nSpecifically, the book defines six separate sets of chapter sections that form\nstreams through the book:\n\n1. A module within a CS II course\n2. A sophomore-level course on software testing\n3. A module in a general software engineering course\n4. A senior-level course on software testing\n5. A first-year MS level course on software testing\n6. An advanced graduate research-oriented course on software testing\n7. Industry practioner relevant sections\nThe stream approach is illustrated in the abbreviated table of contents in\n\nthe figure shown on pp. xix\u2013xx. Each chapter section is marked with which stream\nit belongs too. Of course, individual instructors, students, and readers may prefer\nto adapt the stream to their own interests or purposes. We suggest that the first\ntwo sections of Chapter 1 and the first two sections of Chapter 6 are appropriate\nreading for a module in a data structures (CS II) class, to be followed by a simple\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nPreface xix\n\nStream 1: Module in a CS II course.\n\nStream 2: Sophomore-level course on software testing.\n\nStream 3: Module in a general software engineering course.\n\nStream 4: Senior-level course on software testing.\n\nStream 5: First-year MS course on software testing.\n\nStream 6: Advanced graduate research-oriented course on software testing.\n\nStream 7: Industry practitioner relevant sections\n\nSTREAMS\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nPart I: Overview\nChapter 1.

Our favorite is to ask the students to retrieve one of their previously\ngraded programs and satisfy some simple test criterion like branch coverage. We\noffer points for every fault found, driving home two concepts: an \u201cA\u201d grade doesn\u2019t\nmean the program always works, and finding faults is a good thing.\n\nThe sophomore-level course on software testing (stream 2) is designed to imme-\ndiately follow a data structures course (CS II). The marked sections contain material\nthat depends only on data structures and discrete math.\n\nA module in a general software engineering course (stream 3) could augment the\nsurvey material typical in such courses. The sections marked provide basic literacy\nin software testing.\n\nThe senior-level course on software testing (stream 4) is the primary target\nfor this text. It adds material that requires a little more sophistication in terms of\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 December 6, 2007 2:42 Char Count= 0\n\nPreface xxi\n\nsoftware development than the sophomore stream. This includes sections in Chap-\nter 2 on data flow testing, sections that involve integration testing of multiple mod-\nules, and sections that rely on grammars or finite state machines. Most senior com-\nputer science students will have seen this material in their other courses. Most of the\nsections that appear in stream 4 but not stream 2 could be added to stream 2 with\nappropriate short introductions. It is important to note that a test engineer does not\nneed to know all the theory of parsing to use data flow testing or all the theory on\nfinite state machines to use statecharts for testing.\n\nThe graduate-level course on software testing (stream 5) adds some additional\nsections that rely on a broader context and that require more theoretical maturity.\nFor example, these sections use knowledge of elementary formal methods, polymor-\nphism, and some of the UML diagrams. Some of the more advanced topics and the\nentire chapter on building testing tools are also intended for a graduate audience.\nThis chapter could form the basis for a good project, for example, to implement a\nsimple coverage analyzer.\n\nAn advanced graduate course in software testing with a research emphasis such\nas a PhD seminar (stream 6) includes issues that are still unproven and research in\nnature. The bibliographic notes are recommended only for these students as indica-\ntors for future in-depth reading.\n\nFinally, sections that are reasonably widely used in industry, especially those\nthat have commercial tool support, are marked for stream 7. These sections have a\nminimum of theory and omit criteria that are still of questionable usefulness.\n\nExtensive supplementary materials, including sample syllabuses, PowerPoint\nslides, presentation hints, solutions to exercises, working software, and errata are\navailable on the book\u2019s companion Web site.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nMany people helped us write this book. Not only have the students in our Soft-\nware Testing classes at George Mason been remarkably tolerant of using a work\nin progress, they have enthusiastically provided feedback on how to improve the\ntext.

A software developer can expect to use the concepts pre-\nsented in this book many times during his or her career. This chapter introduces the\nsubject of software testing by describing the activities of a test engineer, defining a\nnumber of key terms, and then explaining the central notion of test coverage.\n\nSoftware is a key ingredient in many of the devices and systems that pervade\nour society. Software defines the behavior of network routers, financial networks,\ntelephone switching networks, the Web, and other infrastructure of modern life.\nSoftware is an essential component of embedded applications that control exotic\napplications such as airplanes, spaceships, and air traffic control systems, as well as\nmundane appliances such as watches, ovens, cars, DVD players, garage door open-\ners, cell phones, and remote controllers. Modern households have over 50 proces-\nsors, and some new cars have over 100; all of them running software that optimistic\nconsumers assume will never fail! Although many factors affect the engineering of\nreliable software, including, of course, careful design and sound process manage-\nment, testing is the primary method that the industry uses to evaluate software un-\nder development. Fortunately, a few basic software testing concepts can be used\nto design tests for a large variety of software applications. A goal of this book is\nto present these concepts in such a way that the student or practicing engineer can\neasily apply them to any software testing situation.\n\nThis textbook differs from other software testing books in several respects.\nThe most important difference is in how it views testing techniques. In his land-\nmark book Software Testing Techniques, Beizer wrote that testing is simple \u2013 all\na tester needs to do is \u201cfind a graph and cover it.\u201d Thanks to Beizer\u2019s insight, it\nbecame evident to us that the myriad testing techniques present in the literature\nhave much more in common than is obvious at first glance. Testing techniques typ-\nically are presented in the context of a particular software artifact (for example, a\nrequirements document or code) or a particular phase of the lifecycle (for exam-\nple, requirements analysis or implementation). Unfortunately, such a presentation\nobscures the underlying similarities between techniques. This book clarifies these\nsimilarities.\n\n3\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n4 Overview\n\nIt turns out that graphs do not characterize all testing techniques well; other\nabstract models are necessary. Much to our surprise, we have found that a small\nnumber of abstract models suffice: graphs, logical expressions, input domain char-\nacterizations, and syntactic descriptions. The main contribution of this book is to\nsimplify testing by classifying coverage criteria into these four categories, and this is\nwhy Part II of this book has exactly four chapters.\n\nThis book provides a balance of theory and practical application, thereby pre-\nsenting testing as a collection of objective, quantitative activities that can be mea-\nsured and repeated. The theory is based on the published literature, and presented\nwithout excessive formalism. Most importantly, the theoretical concepts are pre-\nsented when needed to support the practical activities that test engineers follow.\nThat is, this book is intended for software developers.\n\n1.1 ACTIVITIES OF A TEST ENGINEER\n\nIn this book, a test engineer is an information technology (IT) professional who is in\ncharge of one or more technical test activities, including designing test inputs, pro-\nducing test case values, running test scripts, analyzing results, and reporting results\nto developers and managers. Although we cast the description in terms of test engi-\nneers, every engineer involved in software development should realize that he or she\nsometimes wears the hat of a test engineer. The reason is that each software artifact\nproduced over the course of a product\u2019s development has, or should have, an asso-\nciated set of test cases, and the person best positioned to define these test cases is\noften the designer of the artifact. A test manager is in charge of one or more test en-\ngineers. Test managers set test policies and processes, interact with other managers\non the project, and otherwise help the engineers do their work.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows some of the major activities of test engineers. A test engi-\nneer must design tests by creating test requirements. These requirements are then\n\nTest\nEngineer\n\nTest\nDesigns\n\nExecutable\nTests\n\nComputer EvaluateP Output\n\nTest\nEngineer Test\n\nEngineer\n\ndesign instantiate\n\nexecute\n\n}\n\nTest\nManager\n\nFigure 1.1.

These ex-\necutable tests are run against the software, denoted P in the figure, and the results\nare evaluated to determine if the tests reveal a fault in the software. These activities\nmay be carried out by one person or by several, and the process is monitored by a\ntest manager.\n\nOne of a test engineer\u2019s most powerful tools is a formal coverage criterion. For-\nmal coverage criteria give test engineers ways to decide what test inputs to use dur-\ning testing, making it more likely that the tester will find problems in the program\nand providing greater assurance that the software is of high quality and reliability.\nCoverage criteria also provide stopping rules for the test engineers. The technical\ncore of this book presents the coverage criteria that are available, describes how\nthey are supported by tools (commercial and otherwise), explains how they can best\nbe applied, and suggests how they can be integrated into the overall development\nprocess.\n\nSoftware testing activities have long been categorized into levels, and two kinds\nof levels have traditionally been used. The most often used level categorization is\nbased on traditional software process steps. Although most types of tests can only\nbe run after some part of the software is implemented, tests can be designed and\nconstructed during all software development steps. The most time-consuming parts\nof testing are actually the test design and construction, so test activities can and\nshould be carried out throughout development. The second-level categorization is\nbased on the attitude and thinking of the testers.\n\n1.1.1 Testing Levels Based on Software Activity\n\nTests can be derived from requirements and specifications, design artifacts, or the\nsource code. A different level of testing accompanies each distinct software devel-\nopment activity:\n\n\ufffd Acceptance Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to requirements.\n\ufffd System Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to architectural design.\n\ufffd Integration Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to subsystem design.\n\ufffd Module Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to detailed design.\n\ufffd Unit Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to implementation.\n\nFigure 1.2 illustrates a typical scenario for testing levels and how they relate to\nsoftware development activities by isolating each step. Information for each test\nlevel is typically derived from the associated development activity. Indeed, stan-\ndard advice is to design the tests concurrently with each development activity, even\nthough the software will not be in an executable form until the implementation\nphase. The reason for this advice is that the mere process of explicitly articulat-\ning tests can identify defects in design decisions that otherwise appear reasonable.\nEarly identification of defects is by far the best means of reducing their ultimate\ncost. Note that this diagram is not intended to imply a waterfall process. The syn-\nthesis and analysis activities generically apply to any development process.\n\nThe requirements analysis phase of software development captures the cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs. Acceptance testing is designed to determine whether the completed\nsoftware in fact meets these needs. In other words, acceptance testing probes\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n6 Overview\n\nRequirements\nAnalysis\n\nArchitectural\nDesign\n\nSubsystem\nDesign\n\nDetailed Design\n\nImplementation Unit\nTest\n\nModule\nTest\n\nSystem\nTest\n\nIntegration\nTest\n\nAcceptance\nTest\n\nTest\n\nDesign\n\nInformation\n\nFigure 1.2.

Acceptance testing must involve\nusers or other individuals who have strong domain knowledge.\n\nThe architectural design phase of software development chooses components\nand connectors that together realize a system whose specification is intended to\nmeet the previously identified requirements. System testing is designed to determine\nwhether the assembled system meets its specifications. It assumes that the pieces\nwork individually, and asks if the system works as a whole. This level of testing usu-\nally looks for design and specification problems. It is a very expensive place to find\nlower-level faults and is usually not done by the programmers, but by a separate\ntesting team.\n\nThe subsystem design phase of software development specifies the structure and\nbehavior of subsystems, each of which is intended to satisfy some function in the\noverall architecture. Often, the subsystems are adaptations of previously developed\nsoftware. Integration testing is designed to assess whether the interfaces between\nmodules (defined below) in a given subsystem have consistent assumptions and com-\nmunicate correctly. Integration testing must assume that modules work correctly.\nSome testing literature uses the terms integration testing and system testing inter-\nchangeably; in this book, integration testing does not refer to testing the integrated\nsystem or subsystem. Integration testing is usually the responsibility of members of\nthe development team.\n\nThe detailed design phase of software development determines the structure and\nbehavior of individual modules. A program unit, or procedure, is one or more con-\ntiguous program statements, with a name that other parts of the software use to\ncall it. Units are called functions in C and C++, procedures or functions in Ada,\nmethods in Java, and subroutines in Fortran. A module is a collection of related\nunits that are assembled in a file, package, or class. This corresponds to a file in\nC, a package in Ada, and a class in C++ and Java. Module testing is designed to\nassess individual modules in isolation, including how the component units interact\nwith each other and their associated data structures. Most software development\norganizations make module testing the responsibility of the programmer.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nImplementation is the phase of software development that actually produces\ncode. Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished. This turns out to be\na very simple fault to find during unit testing; indeed analysis showed that almost\nany unit level coverage criterion would have found this multimillion dollar mistake.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n8 Overview\n\nThe Pentium bug not only illustrates the difference in testing levels, but it is also\none of the best arguments for paying more attention to unit testing. There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nThis model does not distinguish between a program\u2019s incorrect behavior and a mis-\ntake within the program, and does very little to help develop software that is reliable\nor safe.\n\nIn Level 1 testing, the purpose is to show correctness. While a significant step up\nfrom the naive level 0, this has the unfortunate problem that in any but the most triv-\nial of programs, correctness is virtually impossible to either achieve or demonstrate.\nSuppose we run a collection of tests and find no failures. What do we know? Should\nwe assume that we have good software or just bad tests? Since the goal of correct-\nness is impossible, test engineers usually have no strict goal, real stopping rule, or\nformal test technique. If a development manager asks how much testing remains to\nbe done, the test manager has no way to answer the question. In fact, test managers\nare in a powerless position because they have no way to quantitatively express or\nevaluate their work.\n\nIn Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures. Although looking for failures\nis certainly a valid goal, it is also a negative goal. Testers may enjoy finding the\nproblem, but the developers never want to find problems \u2013 they want the software\nto work (level 1 thinking is natural for the developers). Thus, level 2 testing puts\ntesters and developers into an adversarial relationship, which can be bad for team\nmorale. Beyond that, when our primary goal is to look for failures, we are still left\nwondering what to do if no failures are found. Is our work done? Is our software\nvery good, or is the testing weak? Having confidence in when testing is complete is\nan important goal for all testers.\n\nThe thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing\ncan show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. This lets us accept the fact\nthat whenever we use software, we incur some risk. The risk may be small and the\nconsequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catas-\ntrophic, but risk is always there. This allows us to realize that the entire develop-\nment team wants the same thing \u2013 to reduce the risk of using the software. In level 3\ntesting, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.\n\nOnce the testers and developers are on the same \u201cteam,\u201d an organization can\nprogress to real Level 4 testing. Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental disci-\npline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating\ntests that cause the software to fail is only one. Adopting this mindset, test engi-\nneers can become the technical leaders of the project (as is common in many other\nengineering disciplines). They have the primary responsibility of measuring and im-\nproving software quality, and their expertise should help the developers. An analogy\nthat Beizer used is that of a spell checker. We often think that the purpose of a spell\nchecker is to find misspelled words, but in fact, the best purpose of a spell checker\nis to improve our ability to spell. Every time the spell checker finds an incorrectly\nspelled word, we have the opportunity to learn how to spell the word correctly. The\nspell checker is the \u201cexpert\u201d on spelling quality. In the same way, level 4 testing\nmeans that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to pro-\nduce high quality software. The testers should train your developers.\n\nAs a reader of this book, you probably start at level 0, 1, or 2. Most software\ndevelopers go through these levels at some stage in their careers. If you work in\nsoftware development, you might pause to reflect on which testing level describes\nyour company or team. The rest of this chapter should help you move to level 2\nthinking, and to understand the importance of level 3. Subsequent chapters will give\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n10 Overview\n\nyou the knowledge, skills, and tools to be able to work at level 3. The ultimate goal\nof this book is to provide a philosophical basis that will allow readers to become\n\u201cchange agents\u201d in their organizations for level 4 thinking, and test engineers to\nbecome software quality experts.\n\n1.1.3 Automation of Test Activities\n\nSoftware testing is expensive and labor intensive. Software testing requires up to\n50% of software development costs, and even more for safety-critical applications.\nOne of the goals of software testing is to automate as much as possible, thereby signi-\nficantly reducing its cost, minimizing human error, and making regression testing\neasier.\n\nSoftware engineers sometimes distinguish revenue tasks, which contribute di-\nrectly to the solution of a problem, from excise tasks, which do not. For example,\ncompiling a Java class is a classic excise task because, although necessary for the\nclass to become executable, compilation contributes nothing to the particular behav-\nior of that class. In contrast, determining which methods are appropriate to define a\ngiven data abstraction as a Java class is a revenue task. Excise tasks are candidates\nfor automation; revenue tasks are not. Software testing probably has more excise\ntasks than any other aspect of software development. Maintaining test scripts, re-\nrunning tests, and comparing expected results with actual results are all common\nexcise tasks that routinely consume large chunks of test engineer\u2019s time. Automat-\ning excise tasks serves the test engineer in many ways. First, eliminating excise tasks\neliminates drudgery, thereby making the test engineers job more satisfying. Second,\nautomation frees up time to focus on the fun and challenging parts of testing, namely\nthe revenue tasks. Third, automation can help eliminate errors of omission, such as\nfailing to update all the relevant files with the new set of expected results. Fourth,\nautomation eliminates some of the variance in test quality caused by differences in\nindividual\u2019s abilities.\n\nMany testing tasks that defied automation in the past are now candidates for such\ntreatment due to advances in technology. For example, generating test cases that\nsatisfy given test requirements is typically a hard problem that requires intervention\nfrom the test engineer. However, there are tools, both research and commercial,\nthat automate this task to varying degrees.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.1.\n\n1. What are some of the factors that would help a development organization\nmove from Beizer\u2019s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4\n(a mental discipline that increases quality)?\n\n2. The following exercise is intended to encourage you to think of testing in a\nmore rigorous way than you may be used to. The exercise also hints at the\nstrong relationship between specification clarity, faults, and test cases.1\n\n(a) Write a Java method with the signature\npublic static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)\n\nThe method should return a Vector of objects that are in either of the\ntwo argument Vectors.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 11\n\n(b) Upon reflection, you may discover a variety of defects and ambiguities\nin the given assignment.

You might wish to illustrate your spec-\nification with examples drawn from your test cases.\n\n1.2 SOFTWARE TESTING LIMITATIONS AND TERMINOLOGY\n\nAs said in the previous section, one of the most important limitations of software\ntesting is that testing can show only the presence of failures, not their absence. This\nis a fundamental, theoretical limitation; generally speaking, the problem of finding\nall failures in a program is undecidable. Testers often call a successful (or effective)\ntest one that finds an error. While this is an example of level 2 thinking, it is also a\ncharacterization that is often useful and that we will use later in this book.\n\nThe rest of this section presents a number of terms that are important in software\ntesting and that will be used later in this book. Most of these are taken from stan-\ndards documents, and although the phrasing is ours, we try to be consistent with the\nstandards. Useful standards for reading in more detail are the IEEE Standard Glos-\nsary of Software Engineering Terminology, DOD-STD-2167A and MIL-STD-498\nfrom the US Department of Defense, and the British Computer Society\u2019s Standard\nfor Software Component Testing.\n\nOne of the most important distinctions to make is between validation and verifi-\ncation.\n\nDefinition 1.1 Validation: The process of evaluating software at the end of\nsoftware development to ensure compliance with intended usage.\n\nDefinition 1.2 Verification: The process of determining whether the products\nof a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements\nestablished during the previous phase.\n\nVerification is usually a more technical activity that uses knowledge about the\nindividual software artifacts, requirements, and specifications. Validation usually\ndepends on domain knowledge; that is, knowledge of the application for which the\nsoftware is written. For example, validation of software for an airplane requires\nknowledge from aerospace engineers and pilots.\n\nThe acronym \u201cIV&V\u201d stands for \u201cindependent verification and validation,\u201d\nwhere \u201cindependent\u201d means that the evaluation is done by nondevelopers. Some-\ntimes the IV&V team is within the same project, sometimes the same company, and\nsometimes it is entirely an external entity. In part because of the independent nature\nof IV&V, the process often is not started until the software is complete and is often\ndone by people whose expertise is in the application domain rather than software\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n12 Overview\n\ndevelopment. This can sometimes mean that validation is given more weight than\nverification.\n\nTwo terms that we have already used are fault and failure. Understanding this dis-\ntinction is the first step in moving from level 0 thinking to level 1 thinking. We adopt\nthe definition of software fault, error, and failure from the dependability community.\n\nDefinition 1.3 Software Fault: A static defect in the software.\n\nDefinition 1.4 Software Error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifes-\ntation of some fault.\n\nDefinition 1.5 Software Failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to\nthe requirements or other description of the expected behavior.\n\nConsider a medical doctor making a diagnosis for a patient. The patient enters\nthe doctor\u2019s office with a list of failures (that is, symptoms). The doctor then must\ndiscover the fault, or root cause of the symptom. To aid in the diagnosis, a doctor\nmay order tests that look for anomalous internal conditions, such as high blood\npressure, an irregular heartbeat, high levels of blood glucose, or high cholesterol. In\nour terminology, these anomalous internal conditions correspond to errors.\n\nWhile this analogy may help the student clarify his or her thinking about faults,\nerrors, and failures, software testing and a doctor\u2019s diagnosis differ in one crucial\nway. Specifically, faults in software are design mistakes. They do not appear spon-\ntaneously, but rather exist as a result of some (unfortunate) decision by a human.\nMedical problems (as well as faults in computer system hardware), on the other\nhand, are often a result of physical degradation. This distinction is important be-\ncause it explains the limits on the extent to which any process can hope to control\nsoftware faults. Specifically, since no foolproof way exists to catch arbitrary mis-\ntakes made by humans, we cannot eliminate all faults from software. In colloquial\nterms, we can make software development foolproof, but we cannot, and should not\nattempt to, make it damn-foolproof.\n\nFor a more technical example of the definitions of fault, error, and failure, con-\nsider the following Java method:\n\npublic static int numZero (int[] x) {\n// Effects: if x == null throw NullPointerException\n// else return the number of occurrences of 0 in x\nint count = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length; i++)\n{\n\nif (x[i] == 0)\n{\n\ncount++;\n}\n\n}\nreturn count;\n\n}\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nThe fault in this program is that it starts looking for zeroes at index 1 instead\nof index 0, as is necessary for arrays in Java. For example, numZero ([2, 7, 0]) cor-\nrectly evaluates to 1, while numZero ([0, 7, 2]) incorrectly evaluates to 0. In both\nof these cases the fault is executed. Although both of these cases result in an error,\nonly the second case results in failure. To understand the error states, we need to\nidentify the state for the program. The state for numZero consists of values for the\nvariables x, count, i, and the program counter (denoted PC). For the first example\ngiven above, the state at the if statement on the very first iteration of the loop is\n( x = [2, 7, 0], count = 0, i = 1, PC = if). Notice that this state is in error precisely be-\ncause the value of i should be zero on the first iteration. However, since the value of\ncount is coincidentally correct, the error state does not propagate to the output, and\nhence the software does not fail. In other words, a state is in error simply if it is not\nthe expected state, even if all of the values in the state, considered in isolation, are\nacceptable. More generally, if the required sequence of states is s0, s1, s2, . . . , and\nthe actual sequence of states is s0, s2, s3, . . . , then state s2 is in error in the second\nsequence.\n\nIn the second case the corresponding (error) state is (x = [0, 7, 2], count = 0, i =\n1, PC = if). In this case, the error propagates to the variable count and is present in\nthe return value of the method. Hence a failure results.\n\nThe definitions of fault and failure allow us to distinguish testing from debugg-\ning.\n\nDefinition 1.6 Testing: Evaluating software by observing its execution.\n\nDefinition 1.7 Test Failure: Execution that results in a failure.\n\nDefinition 1.8 Debugging: The process of finding a fault given a failure.\n\nOf course the central issue is that for a given fault, not all inputs will \u201ctrigger\u201d\nthe fault into creating incorrect output (a failure). Also, it is often very difficult to re-\nlate a failure to the associated fault. Analyzing these ideas leads to the fault/failure\nmodel, which states that three conditions must be present for a failure to be ob-\nserved.\n\n1. The location or locations in the program that contain the fault must be\nreached (Reachability).\n\n2. After executing the location, the state of the program must be incorrect\n(Infection).\n\n3. The infected state must propagate to cause some output of the program to be\nincorrect (Propagation).\n\nThis \u201cRIP\u201d model is very important for coverage criteria such as mutation (Chap-\nter 5) and for automatic test data generation. It is important to note that the RIP\nmodel applies even in the case of faults of omission. In particular, when execution\ntraverses the missing code, the program counter, which is part of the internal state,\nnecessarily has the wrong value.\n\nThe next definitions are less standardized and the literature varies widely. The\ndefinitions are our own but are consistent with common usage. A test engineer must\nrecognize that tests include more than just input values, but are actually multipart\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n14 Overview\n\nsoftware artifacts. The piece of a test case that is referred to the most often is what\nwe call the test case value.\n\nDefinition 1.9 Test Case Values: The input values necessary to complete\nsome execution of the software under test.\n\nNote that the definition of test case values is quite broad. In a traditional batch\nenvironment, the definition is extremely clear. In a Web application, a complete\nexecution might be as small as the generation of part of a simple Web page, or it\nmight be as complex as the completion of a set of commercial transactions. In a\nreal-time system such as an avionics application, a complete execution might be a\nsingle frame, or it might be an entire flight.\n\nTest case values are the inputs to the program that test engineers typically focus\non during testing. They really define what sort of testing we will achieve. However,\ntest case values are not enough. In addition to test case values, other inputs are often\nneeded to run a test. These inputs may depend on the source of the tests, and may be\ncommands, user inputs, or a software method to call with values for its parameters.\nIn order to evaluate the results of a test, we must know what output a correct version\nof the program would produce for that test.\n\nDefinition 1.10 Expected Results: The result that will be produced when exe-\ncuting the test if and only if the program satisfies its intended behavior.\n\nTwo common practical problems associated with software testing are how to\nprovide the right values to the software and observing details of the software\u2019s be-\nhavior. These two ideas are used to refine the definition of a test case.\n\nDefinition 1.11 Software Observability: How easy it is to observe the behav-\nior of a program in terms of its outputs, effects on the environment, and other\nhardware and software components.\n\nDefinition 1.12 Software Controllability: How easy it is to provide a program\nwith the needed inputs, in terms of values, operations, and behaviors.\n\nThese ideas are easily illustrated in the context of embedded software. Embed-\nded software often does not produce output for human consumption, but affects the\nbehavior of some piece of hardware. Thus, observability will be quite low. Likewise,\nsoftware for which all inputs are values entered from a keyboard is easy to control.\nBut an embedded program that gets its inputs from hardware sensors is more diffi-\ncult to control and some inputs may be difficult, dangerous or impossible to supply\n(for example, how does the automatic pilot behave when a train jumps off-track).\nMany observability and controllability problems can be addressed with simulation,\nby extra software built to \u201cbypass\u201d the hardware or software components that in-\nterfere with testing. Other applications that sometimes have low observability and\ncontrollability include component-based software, distributed software and Web\napplications.\n\nDepending on the software, the level of testing, and the source of the tests, the\ntester may need to supply other inputs to the software to affect controllability or\nobservability. For example, if we are testing software for a mobile telephone, the\ntest case values may be long distance phone numbers. We may also need to turn the\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nphone on to put it in the appropriate state and then we may need to press \u201ctalk\u201d\nand \u201cend\u201d buttons to view the results of the test case values and terminate the test.\nThese ideas are formalized as follows.\n\nDefinition 1.13 Prefix Values: Any inputs necessary to put the software into\nthe appropriate state to receive the test case values.\n\nDefinition 1.14 Postfix Values: Any inputs that need to be sent to the soft-\nware after the test case values are sent.\n\nPostfix values can be subdivided into two types.\n\nDefinition 1.15 Verification Values: Values necessary to see the results of the\ntest case values.\n\nDefinition 1.16 Exit Commands: Values needed to terminate the program or\notherwise return it to a stable state.\n\nA test case is the combination of all these components (test case values, expected\nresults, prefix values, and postfix values). When it is clear from context, however, we\nwill follow tradition and use the term \u201ctest case\u201d in place of \u201ctest case values.\u201d\n\nDefinition 1.17 Test Case: A test case is composed of the test case values,\nexpected results, prefix values, and postfix values necessary for a complete\nexecution and evaluation of the software under test.\n\nWe provide an explicit definition for a test set to emphasize that coverage is a\nproperty of a set of test cases, rather than a property of a single test case.\n\nDefinition 1.18 Test Set: A test set is simply a set of test cases.\n\nFinally, wise test engineers automate as many test activities as possible. A cru-\ncial way to automate testing is to prepare the test inputs as executable tests for the\nsoftware. This may be done as Unix shell scripts, input files, or through the use of\na tool that can control the software or software component being tested. Ideally,\nthe execution should be complete in the sense of running the software with the test\ncase values, getting the results, comparing the results with the expected results, and\npreparing a clear report for the test engineer.\n\nDefinition 1.19 Executable Test Script: A test case that is prepared in a form\nto be executed automatically on the test software and produce a report.\n\nThe only time a test engineer would not want to automate is if the cost of au-\ntomation outweighs the benefits. For example, this may happen if we are sure the\ntest will only be used once or if the automation requires knowledge or skills that the\ntest engineer does not have.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.2.\n\n1.

Specifically, the number of poten-\ntial inputs for most programs is so large as to be effectively infinite. Consider a\nJava compiler \u2013 the number of potential inputs to the compiler is not just all Java\nprograms, or even all almost correct Java programs, but all strings. The only limita-\ntion is the size of the file that can be read by the parser. Therefore, the number of\ninputs is effectively infinite and cannot be explicitly enumerated.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nThis is where formal coverage criteria come in. Since we cannot test with all in-\nputs, coverage criteria are used to decide which test inputs to use. The software test-\ning community believes that effective use of coverage criteria makes it more likely\nthat test engineers will find faults in a program and provides informal assurance that\nthe software is of high quality and reliability. While this is, perhaps, more an article\nof faith than a scientifically supported proposition, it is, in our view, the best option\ncurrently available. From a practical perspective, coverage criteria provide useful\nrules for when to stop testing.\n\nThis book defines coverage criteria in terms of test requirements. The basic idea\nis that we want our set of test cases to have various properties, each of which is\nprovided (or not) by an individual test case.2\n\nDefinition 1.20 Test Requirement: A test requirement is a specific element of\na software artifact that a test case must satisfy or cover.\n\nTest requirements usually come in sets, and we use the abbreviation TR to de-\nnote a set of test requirements.\n\nTest requirements can be described with respect to a variety of software artifacts,\nincluding the source code, design components, specification modeling elements, or\neven descriptions of the input space. Later in this book, test requirements will be\ngenerated from all of these.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a non-software example. Suppose we are given the enviable\ntask of testing bags of jelly beans. We need to come up with ways to sample from\nthe bags. Suppose these jelly beans have the following six flavors and come in four\ncolors: Lemon (colored Yellow), Pistachio (Green), Cantaloupe (Orange), Pear\n(White), Tangerine (also Orange), and Apricot (also Yellow). A simple approach to\ntesting might be to test one jelly bean of each flavor. Then we have six test require-\nments, one for each flavor. We satisfy the test requirement \u201cLemon\u201d by selecting\nand, of course, tasting a Lemon jelly bean from a bag of jelly beans. The reader\nmight wish to ponder how to decide, prior to the tasting step, if a given Yellow jelly\nbean is Lemon or Apricot. This dilemma illustrates a classic controllability issue.\n\nAs a more software-oriented example, if the goal is to cover all decisions in the\nprogram (branch coverage), then each decision leads to two test requirements, one\nfor the decision to evaluate to false, and one for the decision to evaluate to true. If\nevery method must be called at least once (call coverage), each method leads to one\ntest requirement.\n\nA coverage criterion is simply a recipe for generating test requirements in a sys-\ntematic way:\n\nDefinition 1.21 Coverage Criterion: A coverage criterion is a rule or collec-\ntion of rules that impose test requirements on a test set.\n\nThat is, the criterion describes the test requirements in a complete and unam-\nbiguous manner. The \u201cflavor criterion\u201d yields a simple strategy for selecting jelly\nbeans. In this case, the set of test requirements, TR, can be formally written out as\n\nTR = {flavor = Lemon, flavor = Pistachio, flavor = Cantaloupe,\nflavor = Pear, flavor = Tangerine, flavor = Apricot}\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n18 Overview\n\nTest engineers need to know how good a collection of tests is, so we measure\ntest sets against a criterion in terms of coverage.\n\nDefinition 1.22 Coverage: Given a set of test requirements TR for a coverage\ncriterion C, a test set T satisfies C if and only if for every test requirement tr\nin TR, at least one test t in T exists such that t satisfies tr .\n\nTo continue the example, a test set T with 12 beans: three Lemon, one Pistachio,\ntwo Cantaloupe, one Pear, one Tangerine, and four Apricot satisfies the \u201cflavor\ncriterion.\u201d Notice that it is perfectly acceptable to satisfy a given test requirement\nwith more than one test.\n\nCoverage is important for two reasons. First, it is sometimes expensive to sat-\nisfy a coverage criterion, so we want to compromise by trying to achieve a certain\ncoverage level.\n\nDefinition 1.23 Coverage Level: Given a set of test requirements TR and a\ntest set T, the coverage level is simply the ratio of the number of test require-\nments satisfied by T to the size of TR.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, some requirements cannot be satisfied. Suppose\nTangerine jelly beans are rare, some bags may not contain any, or it may simply\nbe too difficult to find a Tangerine bean. In this case, the flavor criterion cannot\nbe 100% satisfied, and the maximum coverage level possible is 5/6 or 83%. It often\nmakes sense to drop unsatisfiable test requirements from the set TR \u2013 or to replace\nthem with less stringent test requirements.\n\nTest requirements that cannot be satisfied are called infeasible. Formally, no test\ncase values exist that meet the test requirements. Examples for specific software\ncriteria will be shown throughout the book, but some may already be familiar.\nDead code results in infeasible test requirements because the statements cannot be\nreached. The detection of infeasible test requirements is formally undecidable for\nmost coverage criteria, and even though some researchers have tried to find partial\nsolutions, they have had only limited success. Thus, 100% coverage is impossible in\npractice.\n\nCoverage criteria are traditionally used in one of two ways. One method is to\ndirectly generate test case values to satisfy a given criterion. This method is often\nassumed by the research community and is the most obvious way to use criteria. It is\nalso very hard in some cases, particularly if we do not have enough automated tools\nto support test case value generation. The other method is to generate test case\nvalues externally (by hand or using a pseudo-random tool, for example) and then\nmeasure the tests against the criterion in terms of their coverage. This method is\nusually favored by industry practitioners, because generating tests to directly satisfy\nthe criterion is too hard. Unfortunately, this use is sometimes misleading. If our\ntests do not reach 100% coverage, what does that mean? We really have no data on\nhow much, say, 99% coverage is worse than 100% coverage, or 90%, or even 75%.\nBecause of this use of the criteria to evaluate existing test sets, coverage criteria are\nsometimes called metrics.\n\nThis distinction actually has a strong theoretical basis. A generator is a proce-\ndure that automatically generates values to satisfy a criterion, and a recognizer is a\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nprocedure that decides whether a given set of test case values satisfies a criterion.\nTheoretically, both problems are provably undecidable in the general case for most\ncriteria. In practice, however, it is possible to recognize whether test cases satisfy\na criterion far more often than it is possible to generate tests that satisfy the cri-\nterion. The primary problem with recognition is infeasible test requirements; if no\ninfeasible test requirements are present then the problem becomes decidable.\n\nIn practical terms of commercial automated test tools, a generator corresponds\nto a tool that automatically creates test case values. A recognizer is a coverage anal-\nysis tool. Coverage analysis tools are quite plentiful, both as commercial products\nand freeware.\n\nIt is important to appreciate that the set TR depends on the specific artifact\nunder test. In the jelly bean example, the test requirement color = Purple doesn\u2019t\nmake sense because we assumed that the factory does not make Purple jelly beans.\nIn the software context, consider statement coverage. The test requirement \u201cExe-\ncute statement 42\u201d makes sense only if the program under test does indeed have a\nstatement 42. A good way to think of this issue is that the test engineer starts with a\ngiven software artifact and then chooses a particular coverage criterion. Combining\nthe artifact with the criterion yields the specific set TR that is relevant to the test\nengineer\u2019s task.\n\nCoverage criteria are often related to one another, and compared in terms of\nsubsumption. Recall that the \u201cflavor criterion\u201d requires that every flavor be tried\nonce. We could also define a \u201ccolor criterion,\u201d which requires that we try one jelly\nbean of each color {yellow, green, orange, white}. If we satisfy the flavor criterion,\nthen we have also implicitly satisfied the color criterion. This is the essence of sub-\nsumption; that satisfying one criterion will guarantee that another one is satisfied.\n\nDefinition 1.24 Criteria Subsumption: A coverage criterion C1 subsumes C2\n\nif and only if every test set that satisfies criterion C1 also satisfies C2.\n\nNote that this has to be true for every test set, not just some sets. Subsump-\ntion has a strong similarity with set subset relationships, but it is not exactly the\nsame. Generally, a criterion C1 can subsume another C2 in one of two ways. The\nsimpler way is if the test requirements for C1 always form a superset of the re-\nquirements for C2. For example, another jelly bean criterion may be to try all fla-\nvors whose name begins with the letter \u2018C\u2019. This would result in the test require-\nments {Cantaloupe}, which is a subset of the requirements for the flavor criterion:\n{Lemon, Pistachio, Cantaloupe, Pear, Tangerine, Apricot}. Thus, the flavor criterion\nsubsumes the \u201cstarts-with-C\u201d criterion.\n\nThe relationship between the flavor and the color criteria illustrate the other\nway that subsumption can be shown. Since every flavor has a specific color, and ev-\nery color is represented by at least one flavor, if we satisfy the flavor criterion we will\nalso satisfy the color criterion. Formally, a many-to-one mapping exists between the\nrequirements for the flavor criterion and the requirements for the color criterion.\nThus, the flavor criterion subsumes the color criterion.

There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n# \u30101\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nImplementation is the phase of software development that actually produces\ncode. Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision.

While a significant step up\nfrom the naive level 0, this has the unfortunate problem that in any but the most triv-\nial of programs, correctness is virtually impossible to either achieve or demonstrate.\nSuppose we run a collection of tests and find no failures. What do we know? Should\nwe assume that we have good software or just bad tests? Since the goal of correct-\nness is impossible, test engineers usually have no strict goal, real stopping rule, or\nformal test technique. If a development manager asks how much testing remains to\nbe done, the test manager has no way to answer the question. In fact, test managers\nare in a powerless position because they have no way to quantitatively express or\nevaluate their work.\n\nIn Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures. Although looking for failures\nis certainly a valid goal, it is also a negative goal. Testers may enjoy finding the\nproblem, but the developers never want to find problems \u2013 they want the software\nto work (level 1 thinking is natural for the developers). Thus, level 2 testing puts\ntesters and developers into an adversarial relationship, which can be bad for team\nmorale. Beyond that, when our primary goal is to look for failures, we are still left\nwondering what to do if no failures are found. Is our work done? Is our software\nvery good, or is the testing weak? Having confidence in when testing is complete is\nan important goal for all testers.\n\nThe thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing\ncan show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. This lets us accept the fact\nthat whenever we use software, we incur some risk. The risk may be small and the\nconsequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catas-\ntrophic, but risk is always there. This allows us to realize that the entire develop-\nment team wants the same thing \u2013 to reduce the risk of using the software. In level 3\ntesting, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.\n\nOnce the testers and developers are on the same \u201cteam,\u201d an organization can\nprogress to real Level 4 testing. Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental disci-\npline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating\ntests that cause the software to fail is only one. Adopting this mindset, test engi-\nneers can become the technical leaders of the project (as is common in many other\nengineering disciplines). They have the primary responsibility of measuring and im-\nproving software quality, and their expertise should help the developers. An analogy\nthat Beizer used is that of a spell checker. We often think that the purpose of a spell\nchecker is to find misspelled words, but in fact, the best purpose of a spell checker\nis to improve our ability to spell. Every time the spell checker finds an incorrectly\nspelled word, we have the opportunity to learn how to spell the word correctly. The\nspell checker is the \u201cexpert\u201d on spelling quality. In the same way, level 4 testing\nmeans that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to pro-\nduce high quality software. The testers should train your developers.\n# \u30103\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nThis model does not distinguish between a program\u2019s incorrect behavior and a mis-\ntake within the program, and does very little to help develop software that is reliable\nor safe.\n\nIn Level 1 testing, the purpose is to show correctness.

Software testing requires up to\n50% of software development costs, and even more for safety-critical applications.\nOne of the goals of software testing is to automate as much as possible, thereby signi-\nficantly reducing its cost, minimizing human error, and making regression testing\neasier.\n\nSoftware engineers sometimes distinguish revenue tasks, which contribute di-\nrectly to the solution of a problem, from excise tasks, which do not. For example,\ncompiling a Java class is a classic excise task because, although necessary for the\nclass to become executable, compilation contributes nothing to the particular behav-\nior of that class. In contrast, determining which methods are appropriate to define a\ngiven data abstraction as a Java class is a revenue task. Excise tasks are candidates\nfor automation; revenue tasks are not.

The ultimate goal\nof this book is to provide a philosophical basis that will allow readers to become\n\u201cchange agents\u201d in their organizations for level 4 thinking, and test engineers to\nbecome software quality experts.\n\n1.1.3 Automation of Test Activities\n\nSoftware testing is expensive and labor intensive. Software testing requires up to\n50% of software development costs, and even more for safety-critical applications.\nOne of the goals of software testing is to automate as much as possible, thereby signi-\nficantly reducing its cost, minimizing human error, and making regression testing\neasier.\n\nSoftware engineers sometimes distinguish revenue tasks, which contribute di-\nrectly to the solution of a problem, from excise tasks, which do not. For example,\ncompiling a Java class is a classic excise task because, although necessary for the\nclass to become executable, compilation contributes nothing to the particular behav-\nior of that class. In contrast, determining which methods are appropriate to define a\ngiven data abstraction as a Java class is a revenue task. Excise tasks are candidates\nfor automation; revenue tasks are not. Software testing probably has more excise\ntasks than any other aspect of software development. Maintaining test scripts, re-\nrunning tests, and comparing expected results with actual results are all common\nexcise tasks that routinely consume large chunks of test engineer\u2019s time. Automat-\ning excise tasks serves the test engineer in many ways. First, eliminating excise tasks\neliminates drudgery, thereby making the test engineers job more satisfying. Second,\nautomation frees up time to focus on the fun and challenging parts of testing, namely\nthe revenue tasks. Third, automation can help eliminate errors of omission, such as\nfailing to update all the relevant files with the new set of expected results. Fourth,\nautomation eliminates some of the variance in test quality caused by differences in\nindividual\u2019s abilities.\n\nMany testing tasks that defied automation in the past are now candidates for such\ntreatment due to advances in technology. For example, generating test cases that\nsatisfy given test requirements is typically a hard problem that requires intervention\nfrom the test engineer. However, there are tools, both research and commercial,\nthat automate this task to varying degrees.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.1.\n\n1. What are some of the factors that would help a development organization\nmove from Beizer\u2019s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4\n(a mental discipline that increases quality)?\n\n2. The following exercise is intended to encourage you to think of testing in a\nmore rigorous way than you may be used to. The exercise also hints at the\nstrong relationship between specification clarity, faults, and test cases.1\n\n(a) Write a Java method with the signature\npublic static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)\n\nThe method should return a Vector of objects that are in either of the\ntwo argument Vectors.\n# \u30107\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nDefinition 1.27 Top-Down Testing: Test the main procedure, then go down\nthrough procedures it calls, and so on.\n\nDefinition 1.28 Bottom-Up Testing: Test the leaves in the tree (procedures\nthat make no calls), and move up to the root. Each procedure is tested only\nif all of its children have been tested.\n\nOO software leads to a more general problem. The relationships among classes\ncan be formulated as general graphs with cycles, requiring test engineers to make\nthe difficult choice of what order to test the classes in. This problem is discussed in\nChapter 6.\n\nSome parts of the literature separate static and dynamic testing as follows:\n\nDefinition 1.29 Static Testing: Testing without executing the program. This\nincludes software inspections and some forms of analysis.\n\nDefinition 1.30 Dynamic Testing: Testing by executing the program with real\ninputs.\n\nMost of the literature currently uses \u201ctesting\u201d to refer to dynamic testing and\n\u201cstatic testing\u201d is called \u201cverification activities.\u201d We follow that use in this book and\nit should be pointed out that this book is only concerned with dynamic or execution-\nbased testing.\n\nOne last term bears mentioning because of the lack of definition. Test Strategy\nhas been used to mean a variety of things, including coverage criterion, test process,\nand technologies used. We will avoid using it.\n\n1.5 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAll books on software testing and all researchers owe major thanks to the landmark\nbooks in 1979 by Myers [249], in 1990 by Beizer [29], and in 2000 by Binder [33].\nSome excellent overviews of unit testing criteria have also been published, including\none by White [349] and more recently by Zhu, Hall, and May [367]. The statement\nthat software testing requires up to 50 percent of software development costs is from\nMyers and Sommerville [249, 316]. The recent text from Pezze and Young [289]\nreports relevant processes, principles, and techniques from the testing literature,\nand includes many useful classroom materials. The Pezze and Young text presents\ncoverage criteria in the traditional lifecycle-based manner, and does not organize\ncriteria into the four abstract models discussed in this chapter.\n\nNumerous other software testing books were not intended as textbooks, or do\nnot offer general coverage for classroom use. Beizer\u2019s Software System Testing\nand Quality Assurance [28] and Hetzel\u2019s The Complete Guide to Software Testing\n[160] cover various aspects of management and process for software testing. Several\nbooks cover specific aspects of testing [169, 227, 301].

There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nOne of the most important distinctions to make is between validation and verifi-\ncation.\n\nDefinition 1.1 Validation: The process of evaluating software at the end of\nsoftware development to ensure compliance with intended usage.\n\nDefinition 1.2 Verification: The process of determining whether the products\nof a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements\nestablished during the previous phase.\n\nVerification is usually a more technical activity that uses knowledge about the\nindividual software artifacts, requirements, and specifications. Validation usually\ndepends on domain knowledge; that is, knowledge of the application for which the\nsoftware is written. For example, validation of software for an airplane requires\nknowledge from aerospace engineers and pilots.\n\nThe acronym \u201cIV&V\u201d stands for \u201cindependent verification and validation,\u201d\nwhere \u201cindependent\u201d means that the evaluation is done by nondevelopers. Some-\ntimes the IV&V team is within the same project, sometimes the same company, and\nsometimes it is entirely an external entity. In part because of the independent nature\nof IV&V, the process often is not started until the software is complete and is often\ndone by people whose expertise is in the application domain rather than software\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n12 Overview\n\ndevelopment. This can sometimes mean that validation is given more weight than\nverification.\n\nTwo terms that we have already used are fault and failure. Understanding this dis-\ntinction is the first step in moving from level 0 thinking to level 1 thinking. We adopt\nthe definition of software fault, error, and failure from the dependability community.\n\nDefinition 1.3 Software Fault: A static defect in the software.\n\nDefinition 1.4 Software Error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifes-\ntation of some fault.\n\nDefinition 1.5 Software Failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to\nthe requirements or other description of the expected behavior.\n\nConsider a medical doctor making a diagnosis for a patient. The patient enters\nthe doctor\u2019s office with a list of failures (that is, symptoms). The doctor then must\ndiscover the fault, or root cause of the symptom. To aid in the diagnosis, a doctor\nmay order tests that look for anomalous internal conditions, such as high blood\npressure, an irregular heartbeat, high levels of blood glucose, or high cholesterol. In\nour terminology, these anomalous internal conditions correspond to errors.\n\nWhile this analogy may help the student clarify his or her thinking about faults,\nerrors, and failures, software testing and a doctor\u2019s diagnosis differ in one crucial\nway. Specifically, faults in software are design mistakes. They do not appear spon-\ntaneously, but rather exist as a result of some (unfortunate) decision by a human.\nMedical problems (as well as faults in computer system hardware), on the other\nhand, are often a result of physical degradation. This distinction is important be-\ncause it explains the limits on the extent to which any process can hope to control\nsoftware faults. Specifically, since no foolproof way exists to catch arbitrary mis-\ntakes made by humans, we cannot eliminate all faults from software. In colloquial\nterms, we can make software development foolproof, but we cannot, and should not\nattempt to, make it damn-foolproof.\n\nFor a more technical example of the definitions of fault, error, and failure, con-\nsider the following Java method:\n\npublic static int numZero (int[] x) {\n// Effects: if x == null throw NullPointerException\n// else return the number of occurrences of 0 in x\nint count = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length; i++)\n{\n# \u301013\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[204] H.

Although we cast the description in terms of test engi-\nneers, every engineer involved in software development should realize that he or she\nsometimes wears the hat of a test engineer. The reason is that each software artifact\nproduced over the course of a product\u2019s development has, or should have, an asso-\nciated set of test cases, and the person best positioned to define these test cases is\noften the designer of the artifact. A test manager is in charge of one or more test en-\ngineers. Test managers set test policies and processes, interact with other managers\non the project, and otherwise help the engineers do their work.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows some of the major activities of test engineers. A test engi-\nneer must design tests by creating test requirements.

These ex-\necutable tests are run against the software, denoted P in the figure, and the results\nare evaluated to determine if the tests reveal a fault in the software. These activities\nmay be carried out by one person or by several, and the process is monitored by a\ntest manager.\n\nOne of a test engineer\u2019s most powerful tools is a formal coverage criterion. For-\nmal coverage criteria give test engineers ways to decide what test inputs to use dur-\ning testing, making it more likely that the tester will find problems in the program\nand providing greater assurance that the software is of high quality and reliability.\nCoverage criteria also provide stopping rules for the test engineers. The technical\ncore of this book presents the coverage criteria that are available, describes how\nthey are supported by tools (commercial and otherwise), explains how they can best\nbe applied, and suggests how they can be integrated into the overall development\nprocess.\n\nSoftware testing activities have long been categorized into levels, and two kinds\nof levels have traditionally been used. The most often used level categorization is\nbased on traditional software process steps. Although most types of tests can only\nbe run after some part of the software is implemented, tests can be designed and\nconstructed during all software development steps. The most time-consuming parts\nof testing are actually the test design and construction, so test activities can and\nshould be carried out throughout development. The second-level categorization is\nbased on the attitude and thinking of the testers.\n\n1.1.1 Testing Levels Based on Software Activity\n\nTests can be derived from requirements and specifications, design artifacts, or the\nsource code.

Information for each test\nlevel is typically derived from the associated development activity. Indeed, stan-\ndard advice is to design the tests concurrently with each development activity, even\nthough the software will not be in an executable form until the implementation\nphase. The reason for this advice is that the mere process of explicitly articulat-\ning tests can identify defects in design decisions that otherwise appear reasonable.\nEarly identification of defects is by far the best means of reducing their ultimate\ncost. Note that this diagram is not intended to imply a waterfall process. The syn-\nthesis and analysis activities generically apply to any development process.\n\nThe requirements analysis phase of software development captures the cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs. Acceptance testing is designed to determine whether the completed\nsoftware in fact meets these needs. In other words, acceptance testing probes\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n6 Overview\n\nRequirements\nAnalysis\n\nArchitectural\nDesign\n\nSubsystem\nDesign\n\nDetailed Design\n\nImplementation Unit\nTest\n\nModule\nTest\n\nSystem\nTest\n\nIntegration\nTest\n\nAcceptance\nTest\n\nTest\n\nDesign\n\nInformation\n\nFigure 1.2.

System testing is designed to determine\nwhether the assembled system meets its specifications. It assumes that the pieces\nwork individually, and asks if the system works as a whole. This level of testing usu-\nally looks for design and specification problems. It is a very expensive place to find\nlower-level faults and is usually not done by the programmers, but by a separate\ntesting team.\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision.

There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n",

Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished.\n",

While a significant step up\nfrom the naive level 0, this has the unfortunate problem that in any but the most triv-\nial of programs, correctness is virtually impossible to either achieve or demonstrate.\nSuppose we run a collection of tests and find no failures. What do we know? Should\nwe assume that we have good software or just bad tests? Since the goal of correct-\nness is impossible, test engineers usually have no strict goal, real stopping rule, or\nformal test technique. If a development manager asks how much testing remains to\nbe done, the test manager has no way to answer the question. In fact, test managers\nare in a powerless position because they have no way to quantitatively express or\nevaluate their work.\n\nIn Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures. Although looking for failures\nis certainly a valid goal, it is also a negative goal. Testers may enjoy finding the\nproblem, but the developers never want to find problems \u2013 they want the software\nto work (level 1 thinking is natural for the developers). Thus, level 2 testing puts\ntesters and developers into an adversarial relationship, which can be bad for team\nmorale. Beyond that, when our primary goal is to look for failures, we are still left\nwondering what to do if no failures are found. Is our work done? Is our software\nvery good, or is the testing weak? Having confidence in when testing is complete is\nan important goal for all testers.\n\nThe thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing\ncan show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. This lets us accept the fact\nthat whenever we use software, we incur some risk. The risk may be small and the\nconsequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catas-\ntrophic, but risk is always there. This allows us to realize that the entire develop-\nment team wants the same thing \u2013 to reduce the risk of using the software. In level 3\ntesting, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.\n\nOnce the testers and developers are on the same \u201cteam,\u201d an organization can\nprogress to real Level 4 testing. Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental disci-\npline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating\ntests that cause the software to fail is only one. Adopting this mindset, test engi-\nneers can become the technical leaders of the project (as is common in many other\nengineering disciplines). They have the primary responsibility of measuring and im-\nproving software quality, and their expertise should help the developers. An analogy\nthat Beizer used is that of a spell checker. We often think that the purpose of a spell\nchecker is to find misspelled words, but in fact, the best purpose of a spell checker\nis to improve our ability to spell. Every time the spell checker finds an incorrectly\nspelled word, we have the opportunity to learn how to spell the word correctly. The\nspell checker is the \u201cexpert\u201d on spelling quality. In the same way, level 4 testing\nmeans that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to pro-\nduce high quality software. The testers should train your developers.\n",

Maintaining test scripts, re-\nrunning tests, and comparing expected results with actual results are all common\nexcise tasks that routinely consume large chunks of test engineer\u2019s time. Automat-\ning excise tasks serves the test engineer in many ways. First, eliminating excise tasks\neliminates drudgery, thereby making the test engineers job more satisfying. Second,\nautomation frees up time to focus on the fun and challenging parts of testing, namely\nthe revenue tasks. Third, automation can help eliminate errors of omission, such as\nfailing to update all the relevant files with the new set of expected results. Fourth,\nautomation eliminates some of the variance in test quality caused by differences in\nindividual\u2019s abilities.\n\nMany testing tasks that defied automation in the past are now candidates for such\ntreatment due to advances in technology. For example, generating test cases that\nsatisfy given test requirements is typically a hard problem that requires intervention\nfrom the test engineer. However, there are tools, both research and commercial,\nthat automate this task to varying degrees.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.1.\n\n1.

The exercise also hints at the\nstrong relationship between specification clarity, faults, and test cases.1\n\n(a) Write a Java method with the signature\npublic static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)\n\nThe method should return a Vector of objects that are in either of the\ntwo argument Vectors.\n",

The statement\nthat software testing requires up to 50 percent of software development costs is from\nMyers and Sommerville [249, 316]. The recent text from Pezze and Young [289]\nreports relevant processes, principles, and techniques from the testing literature,\nand includes many useful classroom materials. The Pezze and Young text presents\ncoverage criteria in the traditional lifecycle-based manner, and does not organize\ncriteria into the four abstract models discussed in this chapter.\n\nNumerous other software testing books were not intended as textbooks, or do\nnot offer general coverage for classroom use. Beizer\u2019s Software System Testing\nand Quality Assurance [28] and Hetzel\u2019s The Complete Guide to Software Testing\n[160] cover various aspects of management and process for software testing. Several\nbooks cover specific aspects of testing [169, 227, 301].

There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n",

Validation usually\ndepends on domain knowledge; that is, knowledge of the application for which the\nsoftware is written. For example, validation of software for an airplane requires\nknowledge from aerospace engineers and pilots.\n\nThe acronym \u201cIV&V\u201d stands for \u201cindependent verification and validation,\u201d\nwhere \u201cindependent\u201d means that the evaluation is done by nondevelopers.

This can sometimes mean that validation is given more weight than\nverification.\n\nTwo terms that we have already used are fault and failure. Understanding this dis-\ntinction is the first step in moving from level 0 thinking to level 1 thinking. We adopt\nthe definition of software fault, error, and failure from the dependability community.\n\nDefinition 1.3 Software Fault: A static defect in the software.\n\nDefinition 1.4 Software Error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifes-\ntation of some fault.\n\nDefinition 1.5 Software Failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to\nthe requirements or other description of the expected behavior.\n\nConsider a medical doctor making a diagnosis for a patient. The patient enters\nthe doctor\u2019s office with a list of failures (that is, symptoms). The doctor then must\ndiscover the fault, or root cause of the symptom. To aid in the diagnosis, a doctor\nmay order tests that look for anomalous internal conditions, such as high blood\npressure, an irregular heartbeat, high levels of blood glucose, or high cholesterol. In\nour terminology, these anomalous internal conditions correspond to errors.\n\nWhile this analogy may help the student clarify his or her thinking about faults,\nerrors, and failures, software testing and a doctor\u2019s diagnosis differ in one crucial\nway. Specifically, faults in software are design mistakes. They do not appear spon-\ntaneously, but rather exist as a result of some (unfortunate) decision by a human.\nMedical problems (as well as faults in computer system hardware), on the other\nhand, are often a result of physical degradation. This distinction is important be-\ncause it explains the limits on the extent to which any process can hope to control\nsoftware faults. Specifically, since no foolproof way exists to catch arbitrary mis-\ntakes made by humans, we cannot eliminate all faults from software. In colloquial\nterms, we can make software development foolproof, but we cannot, and should not\nattempt to, make it damn-foolproof.\n\nFor a more technical example of the definitions of fault, error, and failure, con-\nsider the following Java method:\n\npublic static int numZero (int[] x) {\n// Effects: if x == null throw NullPointerException\n// else return the number of occurrences of 0 in x\nint count = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length; i++)\n{\n",

Although we cast the description in terms of test engi-\nneers, every engineer involved in software development should realize that he or she\nsometimes wears the hat of a test engineer. The reason is that each software artifact\nproduced over the course of a product\u2019s development has, or should have, an asso-\nciated set of test cases, and the person best positioned to define these test cases is\noften the designer of the artifact. A test manager is in charge of one or more test en-\ngineers. Test managers set test policies and processes, interact with other managers\non the project, and otherwise help the engineers do their work.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows some of the major activities of test engineers. A test engi-\nneer must design tests by creating test requirements. These requirements are then\n\nTest\nEngineer\n\nTest\nDesigns\n\nExecutable\nTests\n\nComputer EvaluateP Output\n\nTest\nEngineer Test\n\nEngineer\n\ndesign instantiate\n\nexecute\n\n}\n\nTest\nManager\n\nFigure 1.1.

These ex-\necutable tests are run against the software, denoted P in the figure, and the results\nare evaluated to determine if the tests reveal a fault in the software. These activities\nmay be carried out by one person or by several, and the process is monitored by a\ntest manager.\n\nOne of a test engineer\u2019s most powerful tools is a formal coverage criterion. For-\nmal coverage criteria give test engineers ways to decide what test inputs to use dur-\ning testing, making it more likely that the tester will find problems in the program\nand providing greater assurance that the software is of high quality and reliability.\nCoverage criteria also provide stopping rules for the test engineers. The technical\ncore of this book presents the coverage criteria that are available, describes how\nthey are supported by tools (commercial and otherwise), explains how they can best\nbe applied, and suggests how they can be integrated into the overall development\nprocess.\n\nSoftware testing activities have long been categorized into levels, and two kinds\nof levels have traditionally been used. The most often used level categorization is\nbased on traditional software process steps. Although most types of tests can only\nbe run after some part of the software is implemented, tests can be designed and\nconstructed during all software development steps. The most time-consuming parts\nof testing are actually the test design and construction, so test activities can and\nshould be carried out throughout development. The second-level categorization is\nbased on the attitude and thinking of the testers.\n\n1.1.1 Testing Levels Based on Software Activity\n\nTests can be derived from requirements and specifications, design artifacts, or the\nsource code. A different level of testing accompanies each distinct software devel-\nopment activity:\n\n\ufffd Acceptance Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to requirements.\n\ufffd System Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to architectural design.\n\ufffd Integration Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to subsystem design.\n\ufffd Module Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to detailed design.\n\ufffd Unit Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to implementation.\n\nFigure 1.2 illustrates a typical scenario for testing levels and how they relate to\nsoftware development activities by isolating each step. Information for each test\nlevel is typically derived from the associated development activity.\n",

For-\nmal coverage criteria give test engineers ways to decide what test inputs to use dur-\ning testing, making it more likely that the tester will find problems in the program\nand providing greater assurance that the software is of high quality and reliability.\nCoverage criteria also provide stopping rules for the test engineers. The technical\ncore of this book presents the coverage criteria that are available, describes how\nthey are supported by tools (commercial and otherwise), explains how they can best\nbe applied, and suggests how they can be integrated into the overall development\nprocess.\n\nSoftware testing activities have long been categorized into levels, and two kinds\nof levels have traditionally been used. The most often used level categorization is\nbased on traditional software process steps. Although most types of tests can only\nbe run after some part of the software is implemented, tests can be designed and\nconstructed during all software development steps. The most time-consuming parts\nof testing are actually the test design and construction, so test activities can and\nshould be carried out throughout development. The second-level categorization is\nbased on the attitude and thinking of the testers.\n\n1.1.1 Testing Levels Based on Software Activity\n\nTests can be derived from requirements and specifications, design artifacts, or the\nsource code. A different level of testing accompanies each distinct software devel-\nopment activity:\n\n\ufffd Acceptance Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to requirements.\n\ufffd System Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to architectural design.\n\ufffd Integration Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to subsystem design.\n\ufffd Module Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to detailed design.\n\ufffd Unit Testing \u2013 assess software with respect to implementation.\n\nFigure 1.2 illustrates a typical scenario for testing levels and how they relate to\nsoftware development activities by isolating each step. Information for each test\nlevel is typically derived from the associated development activity. Indeed, stan-\ndard advice is to design the tests concurrently with each development activity, even\nthough the software will not be in an executable form until the implementation\nphase. The reason for this advice is that the mere process of explicitly articulat-\ning tests can identify defects in design decisions that otherwise appear reasonable.\nEarly identification of defects is by far the best means of reducing their ultimate\ncost. Note that this diagram is not intended to imply a waterfall process. The syn-\nthesis and analysis activities generically apply to any development process.\n\nThe requirements analysis phase of software development captures the cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs. Acceptance testing is designed to determine whether the completed\nsoftware in fact meets these needs. In other words, acceptance testing probes\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n6 Overview\n\nRequirements\nAnalysis\n\nArchitectural\nDesign\n\nSubsystem\nDesign\n\nDetailed Design\n\nImplementation Unit\nTest\n\nModule\nTest\n\nSystem\nTest\n\nIntegration\nTest\n\nAcceptance\nTest\n\nTest\n\nDesign\n\nInformation\n\nFigure 1.2.

There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n# \u30101\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 7\n\nImplementation is the phase of software development that actually produces\ncode. Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision.

While a significant step up\nfrom the naive level 0, this has the unfortunate problem that in any but the most triv-\nial of programs, correctness is virtually impossible to either achieve or demonstrate.\nSuppose we run a collection of tests and find no failures. What do we know? Should\nwe assume that we have good software or just bad tests? Since the goal of correct-\nness is impossible, test engineers usually have no strict goal, real stopping rule, or\nformal test technique. If a development manager asks how much testing remains to\nbe done, the test manager has no way to answer the question. In fact, test managers\nare in a powerless position because they have no way to quantitatively express or\nevaluate their work.\n\nIn Level 2 testing, the purpose is to show failures. Although looking for failures\nis certainly a valid goal, it is also a negative goal. Testers may enjoy finding the\nproblem, but the developers never want to find problems \u2013 they want the software\nto work (level 1 thinking is natural for the developers). Thus, level 2 testing puts\ntesters and developers into an adversarial relationship, which can be bad for team\nmorale. Beyond that, when our primary goal is to look for failures, we are still left\nwondering what to do if no failures are found. Is our work done? Is our software\nvery good, or is the testing weak? Having confidence in when testing is complete is\nan important goal for all testers.\n\nThe thinking that leads to Level 3 testing starts with the realization that testing\ncan show the presence, but not the absence, of failures. This lets us accept the fact\nthat whenever we use software, we incur some risk. The risk may be small and the\nconsequences unimportant, or the risk may be great and the consequences catas-\ntrophic, but risk is always there. This allows us to realize that the entire develop-\nment team wants the same thing \u2013 to reduce the risk of using the software. In level 3\ntesting, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.\n\nOnce the testers and developers are on the same \u201cteam,\u201d an organization can\nprogress to real Level 4 testing. Level 4 thinking defines testing as a mental disci-\npline that increases quality. Various ways exist to increase quality, of which creating\ntests that cause the software to fail is only one. Adopting this mindset, test engi-\nneers can become the technical leaders of the project (as is common in many other\nengineering disciplines). They have the primary responsibility of measuring and im-\nproving software quality, and their expertise should help the developers. An analogy\nthat Beizer used is that of a spell checker. We often think that the purpose of a spell\nchecker is to find misspelled words, but in fact, the best purpose of a spell checker\nis to improve our ability to spell. Every time the spell checker finds an incorrectly\nspelled word, we have the opportunity to learn how to spell the word correctly. The\nspell checker is the \u201cexpert\u201d on spelling quality. In the same way, level 4 testing\nmeans that the purpose of testing is to improve the ability of the developers to pro-\nduce high quality software. The testers should train your developers.\n# \u30103\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nThis model does not distinguish between a program\u2019s incorrect behavior and a mis-\ntake within the program, and does very little to help develop software that is reliable\nor safe.\n\nIn Level 1 testing, the purpose is to show correctness.

Maintaining test scripts, re-\nrunning tests, and comparing expected results with actual results are all common\nexcise tasks that routinely consume large chunks of test engineer\u2019s time. Automat-\ning excise tasks serves the test engineer in many ways. First, eliminating excise tasks\neliminates drudgery, thereby making the test engineers job more satisfying. Second,\nautomation frees up time to focus on the fun and challenging parts of testing, namely\nthe revenue tasks. Third, automation can help eliminate errors of omission, such as\nfailing to update all the relevant files with the new set of expected results. Fourth,\nautomation eliminates some of the variance in test quality caused by differences in\nindividual\u2019s abilities.\n\nMany testing tasks that defied automation in the past are now candidates for such\ntreatment due to advances in technology. For example, generating test cases that\nsatisfy given test requirements is typically a hard problem that requires intervention\nfrom the test engineer. However, there are tools, both research and commercial,\nthat automate this task to varying degrees.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 1.1.\n\n1. What are some of the factors that would help a development organization\nmove from Beizer\u2019s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4\n(a mental discipline that increases quality)?\n\n2. The following exercise is intended to encourage you to think of testing in a\nmore rigorous way than you may be used to. The exercise also hints at the\nstrong relationship between specification clarity, faults, and test cases.1\n\n(a) Write a Java method with the signature\npublic static Vector union (Vector a, Vector b)\n\nThe method should return a Vector of objects that are in either of the\ntwo argument Vectors.\n# \u30107\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nDefinition 1.27 Top-Down Testing: Test the main procedure, then go down\nthrough procedures it calls, and so on.\n\nDefinition 1.28 Bottom-Up Testing: Test the leaves in the tree (procedures\nthat make no calls), and move up to the root. Each procedure is tested only\nif all of its children have been tested.\n\nOO software leads to a more general problem. The relationships among classes\ncan be formulated as general graphs with cycles, requiring test engineers to make\nthe difficult choice of what order to test the classes in. This problem is discussed in\nChapter 6.\n\nSome parts of the literature separate static and dynamic testing as follows:\n\nDefinition 1.29 Static Testing: Testing without executing the program. This\nincludes software inspections and some forms of analysis.\n\nDefinition 1.30 Dynamic Testing: Testing by executing the program with real\ninputs.\n\nMost of the literature currently uses \u201ctesting\u201d to refer to dynamic testing and\n\u201cstatic testing\u201d is called \u201cverification activities.\u201d We follow that use in this book and\nit should be pointed out that this book is only concerned with dynamic or execution-\nbased testing.\n\nOne last term bears mentioning because of the lack of definition. Test Strategy\nhas been used to mean a variety of things, including coverage criterion, test process,\nand technologies used. We will avoid using it.\n\n1.5 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAll books on software testing and all researchers owe major thanks to the landmark\nbooks in 1979 by Myers [249], in 1990 by Beizer [29], and in 2000 by Binder [33].\nSome excellent overviews of unit testing criteria have also been published, including\none by White [349] and more recently by Zhu, Hall, and May [367]. The statement\nthat software testing requires up to 50 percent of software development costs is from\nMyers and Sommerville [249, 316]. The recent text from Pezze and Young [289]\nreports relevant processes, principles, and techniques from the testing literature,\nand includes many useful classroom materials. The Pezze and Young text presents\ncoverage criteria in the traditional lifecycle-based manner, and does not organize\ncriteria into the four abstract models discussed in this chapter.\n\nNumerous other software testing books were not intended as textbooks, or do\nnot offer general coverage for classroom use. Beizer\u2019s Software System Testing\nand Quality Assurance [28] and Hetzel\u2019s The Complete Guide to Software Testing\n[160] cover various aspects of management and process for software testing. Several\nbooks cover specific aspects of testing [169, 227, 301].

There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n\nOne final note is that object-oriented (OO) software changes the testing levels.\nOO software blurs the distinction between units and modules, so the OO software\ntesting literature has developed a slight variation of these levels. Intramethod testing\nis when tests are constructed for individual methods. Intermethod testing is when\npairs of methods within the same class are tested in concert. Intraclass testing is\nwhen tests are constructed for a single entire class, usually as sequences of calls to\nmethods within the class. Finally, interclass testing is when more than one class is\ntested at the same time. The first three are variations of unit and module testing,\nwhereas interclass testing is a type of integration testing.\n\n1.1.2 Beizer\u2019s Testing Levels Based on Test Process Maturity\n\nAnother categorization of levels is based on the test process maturity level of an\norganization. Each level is characterized by the goal of the test engineers. The fol-\nlowing material is adapted from Beizer [29].\n\nLevel 0 There\u2019s no difference between testing and debugging.\nLevel 1 The purpose of testing is to show that the software works.\nLevel 2 The purpose of testing is to show that the software doesn\u2019t work.\nLevel 3 The purpose of testing is not to prove anything specific, but to reduce\n\nthe risk of using the software.\nLevel 4 Testing is a mental discipline that helps all IT professionals develop\n\nhigher quality software.\n\nLevel 0 is the view that testing is the same as debugging. This is the view that\nis naturally adopted by many undergraduate computer science majors. In most CS\nprogramming classes, the students get their programs to compile, then debug the\nprograms with a few inputs chosen either arbitrarily or provided by the professor.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nIntroduction 9\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nOne of the most important distinctions to make is between validation and verifi-\ncation.\n\nDefinition 1.1 Validation: The process of evaluating software at the end of\nsoftware development to ensure compliance with intended usage.\n\nDefinition 1.2 Verification: The process of determining whether the products\nof a given phase of the software development process fulfill the requirements\nestablished during the previous phase.\n\nVerification is usually a more technical activity that uses knowledge about the\nindividual software artifacts, requirements, and specifications. Validation usually\ndepends on domain knowledge; that is, knowledge of the application for which the\nsoftware is written. For example, validation of software for an airplane requires\nknowledge from aerospace engineers and pilots.\n\nThe acronym \u201cIV&V\u201d stands for \u201cindependent verification and validation,\u201d\nwhere \u201cindependent\u201d means that the evaluation is done by nondevelopers. Some-\ntimes the IV&V team is within the same project, sometimes the same company, and\nsometimes it is entirely an external entity. In part because of the independent nature\nof IV&V, the process often is not started until the software is complete and is often\ndone by people whose expertise is in the application domain rather than software\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n12 Overview\n\ndevelopment. This can sometimes mean that validation is given more weight than\nverification.\n\nTwo terms that we have already used are fault and failure. Understanding this dis-\ntinction is the first step in moving from level 0 thinking to level 1 thinking. We adopt\nthe definition of software fault, error, and failure from the dependability community.\n\nDefinition 1.3 Software Fault: A static defect in the software.\n\nDefinition 1.4 Software Error: An incorrect internal state that is the manifes-\ntation of some fault.\n\nDefinition 1.5 Software Failure: External, incorrect behavior with respect to\nthe requirements or other description of the expected behavior.\n\nConsider a medical doctor making a diagnosis for a patient. The patient enters\nthe doctor\u2019s office with a list of failures (that is, symptoms). The doctor then must\ndiscover the fault, or root cause of the symptom. To aid in the diagnosis, a doctor\nmay order tests that look for anomalous internal conditions, such as high blood\npressure, an irregular heartbeat, high levels of blood glucose, or high cholesterol. In\nour terminology, these anomalous internal conditions correspond to errors.\n\nWhile this analogy may help the student clarify his or her thinking about faults,\nerrors, and failures, software testing and a doctor\u2019s diagnosis differ in one crucial\nway. Specifically, faults in software are design mistakes. They do not appear spon-\ntaneously, but rather exist as a result of some (unfortunate) decision by a human.\nMedical problems (as well as faults in computer system hardware), on the other\nhand, are often a result of physical degradation. This distinction is important be-\ncause it explains the limits on the extent to which any process can hope to control\nsoftware faults. Specifically, since no foolproof way exists to catch arbitrary mis-\ntakes made by humans, we cannot eliminate all faults from software. In colloquial\nterms, we can make software development foolproof, but we cannot, and should not\nattempt to, make it damn-foolproof.\n\nFor a more technical example of the definitions of fault, error, and failure, con-\nsider the following Java method:\n\npublic static int numZero (int[] x) {\n// Effects: if x == null throw NullPointerException\n// else return the number of occurrences of 0 in x\nint count = 0;\nfor (int i = 1; i < x.length; i++)\n{\n# \u301013\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[204] H.

Although we cast the description in terms of test engi-\nneers, every engineer involved in software development should realize that he or she\nsometimes wears the hat of a test engineer. The reason is that each software artifact\nproduced over the course of a product\u2019s development has, or should have, an asso-\nciated set of test cases, and the person best positioned to define these test cases is\noften the designer of the artifact. A test manager is in charge of one or more test en-\ngineers. Test managers set test policies and processes, interact with other managers\non the project, and otherwise help the engineers do their work.\n\nFigure 1.1 shows some of the major activities of test engineers. A test engi-\nneer must design tests by creating test requirements. These requirements are then\n\nTest\nEngineer\n\nTest\nDesigns\n\nExecutable\nTests\n\nComputer EvaluateP Output\n\nTest\nEngineer Test\n\nEngineer\n\ndesign instantiate\n\nexecute\n\n}\n\nTest\nManager\n\nFigure 1.1.

These ex-\necutable tests are run against the software, denoted P in the figure, and the results\nare evaluated to determine if the tests reveal a fault in the software. These activities\nmay be carried out by one person or by several, and the process is monitored by a\ntest manager.\n\nOne of a test engineer\u2019s most powerful tools is a formal coverage criterion. For-\nmal coverage criteria give test engineers ways to decide what test inputs to use dur-\ning testing, making it more likely that the tester will find problems in the program\nand providing greater assurance that the software is of high quality and reliability.\nCoverage criteria also provide stopping rules for the test engineers. The technical\ncore of this book presents the coverage criteria that are available, describes how\nthey are supported by tools (commercial and otherwise), explains how they can best\nbe applied, and suggests how they can be integrated into the overall development\nprocess.\n\nSoftware testing activities have long been categorized into levels, and two kinds\nof levels have traditionally been used. The most often used level categorization is\nbased on traditional software process steps. Although most types of tests can only\nbe run after some part of the software is implemented, tests can be designed and\nconstructed during all software development steps. The most time-consuming parts\nof testing are actually the test design and construction, so test activities can and\nshould be carried out throughout development. The second-level categorization is\nbased on the attitude and thinking of the testers.\n\n1.1.1 Testing Levels Based on Software Activity\n\nTests can be derived from requirements and specifications, design artifacts, or the\nsource code.

Information for each test\nlevel is typically derived from the associated development activity. Indeed, stan-\ndard advice is to design the tests concurrently with each development activity, even\nthough the software will not be in an executable form until the implementation\nphase. The reason for this advice is that the mere process of explicitly articulat-\ning tests can identify defects in design decisions that otherwise appear reasonable.\nEarly identification of defects is by far the best means of reducing their ultimate\ncost. Note that this diagram is not intended to imply a waterfall process. The syn-\nthesis and analysis activities generically apply to any development process.\n\nThe requirements analysis phase of software development captures the cus-\ntomer\u2019s needs. Acceptance testing is designed to determine whether the completed\nsoftware in fact meets these needs. In other words, acceptance testing probes\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n6 Overview\n\nRequirements\nAnalysis\n\nArchitectural\nDesign\n\nSubsystem\nDesign\n\nDetailed Design\n\nImplementation Unit\nTest\n\nModule\nTest\n\nSystem\nTest\n\nIntegration\nTest\n\nAcceptance\nTest\n\nTest\n\nDesign\n\nInformation\n\nFigure 1.2.

System testing is designed to determine\nwhether the assembled system meets its specifications. It assumes that the pieces\nwork individually, and asks if the system works as a whole. This level of testing usu-\nally looks for design and specification problems. It is a very expensive place to find\nlower-level faults and is usually not done by the programmers, but by a separate\ntesting team.\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

Testing Process (Beizer's Levels of Thinking)\n\n| **Level** | **Mindset** | **Goal** |\n|----------|--------------|----------|\n| Level 0 | Testing = Debugging | No distinction between testing/debugging |\n| Level 1 | Show that it works | Overly optimistic, lacks stopping rules |\n| Level 2 | Show that it doesn\u2019t work | Detect faults, may cause conflict with developers |\n| Level 3 | Reduce risk of using software | Collaborative quality focus |\n| Level 4 | Improve quality as discipline | Testers = quality leaders\u301011:3\u2020source\u3011 |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Key Testing Terminologies\n\n| **Term** | **Definition** |\n|---------|----------------|\n| **Verification** | Are we building the product *right*? (Conforms to specs)\u301011:12\u2020source\u3011 |\n| **Validation** | Are we building the *right* product? (Meets user needs) |\n| **Testing** | Execution of code to find faults |\n| **Fault (Bug)** | Static defect in code |\n| **Error** | Internal incorrect state |\n| **Failure** | External incorrect behavior |\n| **Test Case** | Input + expected output |\n| **Coverage Criteria** | Rules to measure how much testing is done\u301011:17\u2020source\u3011 |\n\n---\n\n### 7. Types of Testing\n\n| **Type** | **Purpose** |\n|----------|------------|\n| Unit Testing | Test individual units/modules |\n| Integration Testing | Test combined modules |\n| System Testing | Test whole system vs design |\n| Acceptance Testing | Test system vs user requirements |\n| Beta Testing | Real users test before release |\n| Functional Testing | Based on functional specs |\n| Stress Testing | Evaluate under extreme conditions |\n| Performance Testing | Check response time, throughput |\n| Usability Testing | Focus on user interface/experience |\n| Regression Testing | Ensure updates don\u2019t break old functionality\u301011:1\u2020source\u3011 |\n\n---\n\n### 8. Testing Methods\n\n| **Method** | **Description** |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Black Box Testing** | No code knowledge; based on inputs/outputs (Functional)\u301011:7\u2020source\u3011 |\n| **White Box Testing** | Code-aware; tests paths, branches, etc. |\n| **Grey Box Testing** | Partial knowledge; combines black & white box advantages |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd8 Textbook Reference\n\n- *Introduction to Software Testing*, Ammann & Offutt (Cambridge)\n  - Key content from **Chapter 1**, especially pages 3\u201323.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf CST458 Exam Tips (2019 Scheme)\n\n- **Part A (3 marks)**: Definitions \u2013 Fault/Error/Failure, Black vs White box, Verification vs Validation.\n- **Part B (14 marks)**:\n  - Q on Beizer\u2019s Levels with explanation.\n  - Case studies (Ariane 5 / Pentium) + fault analysis.\n  - Compare testing types or methods with examples.\n  - Design test cases or identify suitable types of testing.\n\n---\n\nWould you like flashcards, quiz questions, or past paper solutions for practice next?"

                            "Awesome! Let\u2019s now explore:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Topic 3: **Why Should Software Be Tested?**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd8 Motivation from Textbook\n\n**\ud83d\udccdReference: Page 3\u20134, and Page 12\u201313**\n\nTesting is **essential** because software today runs everything\u2014from mobile phones to rockets. Faults can have **serious consequences**, ranging from financial losses to loss of life (as seen in Ariane 5, Therac-25).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac Textbook Insight\n\n> \u201cTesting is the primary method the industry uses to evaluate software under development.\u201d  \n> \u2014 *Page 3, Introduction Section*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Reasons Why Software Must Be Tested\n\n#### 1. **To Detect Faults Early**\n- Faults (bugs) are cheaper to fix when detected early (during development).\n- Example: Pentium bug\u2014if caught in unit testing, millions could\u2019ve been saved.\n\n#### 2. **To Improve Software Quality**\n- Reduces failure risk.\n- Increases confidence in the software\u2019s correctness and reliability.\n\n#### 3. **To Validate User Requirements**\n- Ensures that the software does **what the user wants** (validation).\n- Important in domains like medical devices, aerospace, banking.\n\n#### 4. **To Support Maintenance**\n- Continuous testing (like regression tests) helps in safely adding features.\n\n#### 5. **To Reduce Risk**\n- Testing identifies risks before they impact the customer.\n- Particularly important in **safety-critical** systems.\n\n#### 6. **To Meet Business & Legal Requirements**\n- Compliance in fields like healthcare, automotive (e.g., FDA, ISO standards).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Simple Analogy\n\n> **Testing is like a spell checker for software.**  \nIt doesn\u2019t just catch mistakes\u2014it helps developers learn and improve their \u201cspelling\u201d (i.e., coding discipline).\n\n(Refer: Beizer\u2019s Level 4 thinking, Page 10)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Real-World Perspective\n\n| Without Testing | With Testing |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| Users report failures | Faults caught before release |\n| Brand reputation drops | Confidence in quality |\n| Maintenance costs rise | Easier, safer updates |\n| Safety/security risks | Controlled, compliant system |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Bonus: Developer vs Tester View\n\n| Role | Common View |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Developer** | \u201cI want to prove the software works.\u201d |\n| **Tester** | \u201cI want to discover how it fails.\u201d |\n\n(Refer to Level 1 vs Level 2 thinking from Beizer, **Page 9**)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf93 CST458 Exam Usage\n\n- **Part A (3 marks)**: \"Why test software?\" \u2013 List 3 points with short examples.\n- **Part B (14 marks)**: Combined with \u201cRole of Testing\u201d or \u201cReal-world failures\u201d for essay-style answers.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd16 Page Reference Summary\n\n| Content | Page |\n|--------|------|\n| Role of testing in software | Page 3\u20134 |\n| Testing vs Faults | Page 12 |\n| Testing as Quality Discipline | Page 9\u201310 (Beizer\u2019s Levels) |\n\n---\n\nWould you like to continue to the next topic: **Software Quality & Role of Testing**?"

                            "Let\u2019s now cover the final topic in Module 1:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Topic 9: **Testing Methods \u2013 Black Box, White Box, and Grey Box Testing**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Overview\n\nSoftware testing methods are classified according to the tester\u2019s knowledge of the internal workings of the software. The three primary testing methods are:\n\n- **Black Box Testing**\n- **White Box Testing**\n- **Grey Box Testing**\n\nEach method has its own philosophy, objectives, and applicable contexts. These distinctions are vital when choosing the appropriate testing strategy for a project.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Black Box Testing\n\n**Definition**:  \nBlack box testing is a method in which the tester evaluates the software solely based on its inputs and expected outputs. The internal code structure, implementation details, and design are not considered.\n\n**Key Characteristics**:\n- **Focus on Requirements**: Test cases are designed from specifications, requirements, and user stories.\n- **User-Centric**: Closely related to system and acceptance testing, where the tester simulates end-user behavior.\n- **No Code Awareness Needed**: Testers do not need to know or access the source code.\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Can be performed independently of the development process.\n- Reflects real-world user scenarios and functional behavior.\n- Useful for validating that the application meets the business requirements.\n\n**Disadvantages**:\n- Limited in uncovering internal faults or inefficient code paths.\n- May miss structural issues that do not affect input/output behavior directly.\n\n**Example in Practice**:  \nWhen testing an online banking system, black box tests might include verifying if a fund transfer returns a confirmation message or whether invalid input (such as negative amounts) triggers an appropriate error message.\n\n**Textbook Reference**:  \nAlthough *Introduction to Software Testing* by Ammann & Offutt does not dedicate an entire chapter to black box testing alone, the principles are implicitly discussed throughout the testing techniques and coverage criteria sections (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 for examples that stress specification-based testing).\n\n---\n\n### 3. White Box Testing\n\n**Definition**:  \nWhite box testing (also known as structural or glass box testing) involves testing the internal structures or workings of an application. The tester uses knowledge of the source code, architecture, and design to create test cases.\n\n**Key Characteristics**:\n- **Code Awareness**: Testers examine code paths, conditionals, loops, and data structures.\n- **Coverage Focus**: Strategies like statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage, and condition coverage are central.\n- **Optimization**: Helps detect code-level errors that might be missed by black box methods.\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Can reveal hidden errors within code logic.\n- Allows optimization of code through precise measurements (e.g., identifying dead code).\n- Facilitates the use of automated tools (e.g., unit testing frameworks like JUnit, coverage analyzers).\n\n**Disadvantages**:\n- Requires detailed knowledge of the codebase.\n- May not capture discrepancies between design requirements and actual implementation.\n- Can be time-consuming especially for large codebases.\n\n**Example in Practice**:  \nIn a Java application, a white box test of a function calculating the number of zeros in an array may involve checking all possible loop iterations and branch outcomes\u2014ensuring that starting the loop at index 0 (and not 1) is correctly implemented.\n\n**Textbook Reference**:  \nThe textbook discusses white box testing indirectly in the context of test coverage criteria, such as in the discussion on fault detection in code and examples like the `numZero()` function (Pages 13\u201314).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Grey Box Testing\n\n**Definition**:  \nGrey box testing is a hybrid approach that combines aspects of both black box and white box testing. Testers have partial knowledge of the internal code and use that information to design test cases, while still primarily validating the system\u2019s external behavior.\n\n**Key Characteristics**:\n- **Partial Code Knowledge**: Testers understand the underlying architecture or data flows, yet test using the externally observable behavior.\n- **Balanced Approach**: Aims to cover both functional requirements and internal logic.\n- **Efficiency**: It can uncover defects that neither method (black or white) might detect independently.\n\n**Advantages**:\n- Better test coverage than pure black box testing with less expense than full white box testing.\n- Useful for integration testing where interfaces and interactions between modules are important.\n- Can leverage available documentation and design models to develop targeted tests.\n\n**Disadvantages**:\n- May require additional effort to determine the right balance of internal knowledge.\n- Not as exhaustive as full white box testing in terms of code path analysis.\n- The effectiveness can vary depending on the tester\u2019s ability to understand system internals.\n\n**Example in Practice**:  \nIn web application testing, a grey box tester might know the database schema or API specifications and design tests that validate both the end-to-end user experience and the data integrity behind the scenes.\n\n**Textbook Reference**:  \nWhile grey box testing is not always separately delineated in early chapters, its principles emerge when discussing test design techniques that draw from both specification-based and structure-based methods (refer to the discussions on coverage criteria and integrated testing approaches in Chapter 1).\n\n---\n\n### 5.

This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n\nForman also suggested a way to detect data flow anomalies without running the\nprogram [121].\n\nSome detailed problems with data flow testing have been recurring. These in-\nclude the application of data flow when paths between definitions and uses cannot\nbe executed [127], and handling pointers and arrays [267, 345].\n\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n# \u30103\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[117] Roger Ferguson and Bogdan Korel.

Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n\nCoupling was first discussed as a design metric by Constantine and Yourdon [88],\nand its use for testing was introduced implicitly by Harrold, Soffa, and Rothermel\n[152, 154] and explicitly by Jin and Offutt [178], who introduced the use of first-uses\nand last-defs.\n\nKim, Hong, Cho, Bae, and Cha used a graph-based approach to generate tests\nfrom UML state diagrams [186].\n\nThe USA\u2019s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has recognized the increased\nimportance of modularity and integration testing by imposing requirements on\nstructural coverage analysis of software that \u201cthe analysis should confirm the data\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 103\n\ncoupling and control coupling between the code components\u201d [305], p. 33, section\n6.4.4.2.\n\nData flow testing has also been applied to integration testing by Harrold and\nSoffa [154], Harrold and Rothermel [152], and Jin and Offutt [178]. This work\nfocused on class-level integration issues, but did not address inheritance or poly-\nmorphism. Data flow testing has been applied to inheritance and polymorphism in\nobject-oriented software by Alexander and Offutt [11, 10, 12], and Buy, Orso, and\nPezze [60, 281]. Gallagher and Offutt modeled classes as interacting state machines,\nand tested concurrency and communication issues among them [132].\n\nSCR was first discussed by Henninger [157], and its use in model checking and\ntesting was introduced by Atlee [20].\n\nConstructing tests from UML diagrams is a more recent development, though\nrelatively straightforward. It was first suggested by Abdurazik and Offutt [2, 264],\nand soon followed by Briand and Labiche [45].\n# \u30105\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 237\n\nthe object. The collection of methods that can be executed is called the polymorphic\ncall set (PCS). In this example, the PCS for x.m() is {A::m(), B::m()}.\n\n7.1.1 Unique Issues with Testing OO Software\n\nSeveral testing issues are unique to object-oriented software. Some researchers have\nclaimed that traditional testing techniques are not as effective for object-oriented\nsoftware and sometimes test the wrong things. Methods tend to be smaller and less\ncomplex, so path-based testing techniques may be less useful. As discussed previ-\nously, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding introduce special problems.\nThe execution path is no longer based on the class\u2019s static declared type, but the\ndynamic type; and that is not known until execution.\n\nWhen testing object-oriented software, a class is usually regarded as the basic\nunit of testing. This leads to four levels of testing classes.\n\n1. Intra-method testing: Tests are constructed for individual methods (this is tra-\nditional unit testing)\n\n2. Inter-method testing: Multiple methods within a class are tested in concert\n(this is traditional module testing)\n\n3. Intra-class testing: Tests are constructed for a single class, usually as sequences\nof calls to methods within the class\n\n4. Inter-class testing: More than one class is tested at the same time, usually to\nsee how they interact (this is a type of integration testing)\n\nEarly research in object-oriented testing focused on the inter-method and intra-\nclass levels. Later research focused on the testing of interactions between single\nclasses and their users and system-level testing of OO software. Problems associated\nwith inheritance, dynamic binding and polymorphism cannot be addressed at the\ninter-method or intra-class levels. These require multiple classes that are coupled\nthrough inheritance and polymorphism, that is, inter-class testing.\n\nMost research in object-oriented testing has focused on one of two problems.\nOne is the ordering in which classes should be integrated and tested. The CITO\nproblem was discussed in Chapter 6. The other is developing techniques and cov-\nerage criteria for selecting tests. These coverage criteria are refinements of one or\nmore of the criteria presented in the earlier chapters.\n\n7.1.2 Types of Object-Oriented Faults\n\nOne of the hardest tasks for object-oriented software engineers is visualizing the in-\nteractions that can occur in the presence of inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic\nbinding. They are often very complex! This visualization assumes a class encapsu-\nlates state information in a collection of state variables, and has a set of behaviors\nthat are implemented by methods that use those state variables.\n\nAs an example, consider the UML class diagram and code fragment shown\nin Figure 7.1. In the figure, V and X extend W, V overrides method m(), and X\noverrides methods m() and n(). The minuses (\u201c\u2013\u201d) indicate the attributes are pri-\nvate and the pluses (\u201c+\u201d) indicate the attributes are non-private. The declared\ntype of o is W, but at line 10, the actual type can be either V or W. Since V\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n238 Applying Criteria in Practice\n\nW\n\u2212v\n+m()\n+n()\n\n+m()\n+n()\n\nX\n\n+m()\n\nV\n\u2212x\n\n(a ) (b)\n# \u30106\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[109] Elfriede Dustin, Jeff Rashka, and John Paul.

The statement\nthat software testing requires up to 50 percent of software development costs is from\nMyers and Sommerville [249, 316]. The recent text from Pezze and Young [289]\nreports relevant processes, principles, and techniques from the testing literature,\nand includes many useful classroom materials. The Pezze and Young text presents\ncoverage criteria in the traditional lifecycle-based manner, and does not organize\ncriteria into the four abstract models discussed in this chapter.\n\nNumerous other software testing books were not intended as textbooks, or do\nnot offer general coverage for classroom use. Beizer\u2019s Software System Testing\nand Quality Assurance [28] and Hetzel\u2019s The Complete Guide to Software Testing\n[160] cover various aspects of management and process for software testing. Several\nbooks cover specific aspects of testing [169, 227, 301].

The definition of integration testing is\nfrom Beizer [29]. The clarification for OO testing levels with the terms intra-method,\ninter-method, and intra-class testing is from Harrold and Rothermel [152] and\ninter-class testing is from Gallagher, Offutt and Cincotta [132].\n\nThe information for the Pentium bug and Mars lander was taken from several\nsources, including by Edelman, Moler, Nuseibeh, Knutson, and Peterson [111, 189,\n244, 259, 286].

Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished.\n# \u30109\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nBibliography 303\n\n[124] Phyllis G.

In 1976,\nMcCabe [232] suggested the same idea on control flow graphs as the primary ap-\nplication of his cyclomatic complexity metric. In 1976, Pimont and Rault [290] sug-\ngested covering pairs of edges, using the term \u201cswitch cover.\u201d In 1978, Chow [77]\nsuggested generating a spanning tree from the FSM and then basing test sequences\non paths through this tree. In 1991, Fujiwara et al. [130] extended Pimont and\nRault\u2019s pairs of edges to arbitrary lengths, and used the term \u201cn-switch\u201d to refer\nto a sequence of edges. He also attributed \u201c1-switch,\u201d or switch cover, to Chow and\ncalled it the \u201cW-method,\u201d an inaccuracy that has been repeated in numerous pa-\npers. The idea of covering pairs of edges was rediscovered in the 1990s. The British\nComputer Society Standard for Software Component Testing called it two-trip [317]\nand Offutt et al. [272], called it transition-pair.\n\nOther test generation methods based on FSMs include tour [251], the distin-\nguished sequence method [137], and unique input-output method [307]. Their ob-\njectives are to detect output errors based on state transitions driven by inputs. FSM-\nbased test generation has been used to test a variety of applications including lex-\nical analyzers, real-time process control software, protocols, data processing, and\ntelephony. One early realization when developing this book is that the criteria for\ncovering FSMs are not substantially different from criteria for other graphs.\n\nThis book has introduced the explicit inclusion of node coverage requirements in\nedge coverage requirements (the \u201cup to\u201d clause). This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n# \u301011\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nSe-\nlection techniques include linear equations, symbolic execution, path analysis, data\nflow analysis, program dependence graphs, system dependence graphs, modification\nanalysis, firewall definition, cluster identification, slicing, graph walks, and modified\nentity analysis. For example, as a reader of Chapter 2 might guess, data flow selec-\ntion techniques choose tests only if they touch new, modified, or deleted DU pairs;\nother tests are omitted.\n\nA selection technique is inclusive to the degree that it includes tests that are\n\u201cmodification-revealing.\u201d Unsafe techniques have inclusiveness of less than 100%.\nA technique is precise to the extent that it omits regression tests that are not\nmodification-revealing. A technique is efficient to the degree that determine the\nappropriate subset of the regression test set is less computationally intensive than\nsimply executing the omitted tests. Finally, a technique is general to the degree that\napplies to a wide variety of practical situations. To continue the example, the data\nflow approach to selecting regression tests is not necessarily either safe or precise, of\npolynomial complexity in certain program attributes, and requires, obviously, data\nflow information and program instrumentation at the data flow graph level. The bib-\nliographic notes section contains pointers to further details on this work, including\nempirical evaluations.\n\n6.2 INTEGRATION AND TESTING\n\nSoftware is composed of many pieces of varying sizes. Individual programmers are\noften responsible for testing the lowest level components (classes, modules, and\nmethods). After that, testing must be carried out in collaboration with software in-\ntegration. Software can be integrated in many ways. This section discusses technical\nstrategies that must be employed during testing. We do not try to catalog all of them\nfrom a process point of view.\n\nIntegration testing is the testing of incompatibilities and interfaces between oth-\nerwise correctly working components. That is, it is the testing needed to integrate\nsubcomponents into a bigger working component.

The two most common\ntypes of scaffolding are known as test stubs and test drivers. A test stub is a skeletal\nor special-purpose implementation of a software module, used to develop or test a\ncomponent that calls the stub or otherwise depends on it. It replaces a called com-\nponent. For OO programs, the XP community has developed a version of the stub\ncalled the mock. A mock is a special-purpose replacement class that includes behav-\nior verification to check that a class under test made the correct calls to the mock. A\ntest driver is a software component or test tool that replaces a component that takes\ncare of the control and/or the calling of a software component.\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished. This turns out to be\na very simple fault to find during unit testing; indeed analysis showed that almost\nany unit level coverage criterion would have found this multimillion dollar mistake.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n8 Overview\n\nThe Pentium bug not only illustrates the difference in testing levels, but it is also\none of the best arguments for paying more attention to unit testing. There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n# \u301013\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[360] Ye Wu, Jeff Offutt, and Xiaochen Du.

This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n\nThe notion of subpath sets was developed by Offutt et al. [178, 265] to sup-\nport inter-class path testing and is essentially equivalent to tours with detours as\npresented here. The ideas of touring, sidetrips and detours were introduced by\nAmmann, Offutt and Huang [17].\n\nThe earliest reference we have found on data flow testing was a technical report\nin 1974 by Osterweil and Fosdick [282]. This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n# \u301015\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFull inter-procedural data flow identifies all du-pairs between a caller (A()) and\na callee (B()).

For the variable\nreference to be the same, both A() and B() must be called through the same instance\ncontext, or object reference. That is, if the calls are o.A() and o.B(), they are called\nthrough the instance context of o. If the calls are not made through the same instance\ncontext, the definition and use will be to different instances of the variable.\n\nThe right side of Figure 2.30 illustrates \u201cindirect\u201d du-pairs. In this scenario, the\ncoupling method F() calls two methods, M() and N(), which in turn call two other\nmethods, A() and B(). The def and use are in A() and B(), so the reference is indirect.\nThe analysis for indirect du-pairs is considerably more complicated than for direct\ndu-pairs. It should be obvious that there can be more than one call between the\ncoupling method and the methods with the def and use.\n\nIn OO data flow testing, the methods A() and B() could be in the same class, or\nthey could be in different classes and accessing the same global variables.\n\nFinally, Figure 2.31 illustrates du-pairs in distributed software. P1 and P2 are two\nprocesses, threads, or other distributed software components, and they call A() and\nB(), which def and use the same variable. The distribution and communication could\nuse any of a number of methods, including HTTP (Web-based), remote method\ninvocation (RMI), or CORBA. A() and B() could be in the same class or could access\na persistent variable such as a Web session variable or permanent data store. While\nthis sort of \u201cvery loosely coupled\u201d software can be expected to have far fewer du-\npairs, identifying them, finding def-clear paths between them, and designing test\ncases to cover them is quite complicated.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.4.\n# \u301016\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nKim, Hong, Cho, Bae, and Cha used a graph-based approach to generate tests\nfrom UML state diagrams [186].\n\nThe USA\u2019s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has recognized the increased\nimportance of modularity and integration testing by imposing requirements on\nstructural coverage analysis of software that \u201cthe analysis should confirm the data\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 103\n\ncoupling and control coupling between the code components\u201d [305], p. 33, section\n6.4.4.2.\n\nData flow testing has also been applied to integration testing by Harrold and\nSoffa [154], Harrold and Rothermel [152], and Jin and Offutt [178]. This work\nfocused on class-level integration issues, but did not address inheritance or poly-\nmorphism. Data flow testing has been applied to inheritance and polymorphism in\nobject-oriented software by Alexander and Offutt [11, 10, 12], and Buy, Orso, and\nPezze [60, 281]. Gallagher and Offutt modeled classes as interacting state machines,\nand tested concurrency and communication issues among them [132].\n\nSCR was first discussed by Henninger [157], and its use in model checking and\ntesting was introduced by Atlee [20].\n\nConstructing tests from UML diagrams is a more recent development, though\nrelatively straightforward. It was first suggested by Abdurazik and Offutt [2, 264],\nand soon followed by Briand and Labiche [45].\n\nThe mechanisms for turning finite automata into regular expressions are stan-\ndard fare in CS theory classes. As far as we know, Beizer [29] was the first to note\nthe utility of these transformations in the testing context.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 By way of example, typical control flow graphs have very few, if any, syntactically unreach-\nable nodes, but call graphs, especially for object-oriented programs, often do.\n\n2 Our mathematician readers might notice that this definition is constructive in that it defines\nwhat is in the set TR, but does not actually bound the set. It is certainly our intention that\nTR contains no other elements.\n\n3 The reader might wonder why NOTFOUND fails to appear in the set use(2). The reason, as\nexplained in Section 2.3.2 is that the use is local.\n\n4 The reader is cautioned that despite the names of the criteria, All-Defs and All-Uses are\nnot complementary criteria with respect to how they tread definitions and uses. Specifi-\ncally, one does not arrive at All-Uses by replacing the notion of \u201cdef\u201d with that of \u201cuse\u201d\nin All-Defs. The reader might find it helpful to note that while All-Defs focuses on defini-\ntions, All-Uses focuses on def-use pairs. While one could argue that the naming convention\nis misleading, and that a name such as \u201cAll-Pairs\u201d might be preferable to All-Uses, the au-\nthors elected to stick with the standard usage in the dataflow literature.\n# \u301017\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nBypass testing creates inputs that intentionally violate these validation rules and\nconstraints, then submits the inputs directly to the web application without letting\nthe web page validate them.\n\nA limitation of both these approaches comes from the fact that finding all the\nscreens in a web application is undecidable. They rely on heuristic searches to try\nto identify all screens, but if some screens only appear when certain rare inputs are\nprovided, it may be very difficult to find them. Server-side approaches may have the\nability to look at program source, and therefore find more potential screens.\n\nServer-Side Testing of Web Applications\nWeb software applications allow changes in the control of execution of the applica-\ntion that do not appear in traditional software. In traditional programs, the control\nflow is fully managed by the program, so the tester can only affect it through test\ninputs. Web applications do not have this same property. When executing web ap-\nplications, users can break the normal control flow without alerting the \u201cprogram\ncontroller.\u201d The model of program controller that is still taught in basic program-\nming and operating system classes does not exactly apply to web applications be-\ncause the flow of control is distributed across the client and one or more servers.\nUsers can modify the expected control flow on the client by pressing the back or\nrefresh buttons in the browser or by directly modifying the URL in the browser.\nThese interactions introduce unanticipated changes in the execution flow, creating\ncontrol paths cannot be represented with traditional techniques such as control flow\ngraphs. Users can also directly affect data in unpredictable ways, for example, by\nmodifying values of hidden form fields. Furthermore, changes in the client-side con-\nfiguration may affect the behavior of web applications. For example, users can turn\noff cookies, which can cause subsequent operations to malfunction.\n\nThis analysis leads to a number of new connections, which we categorize as fol-\nlows.\n\n\ufffd Traditional static links are represented in HTML with the <A> tag.\n\ufffd Dynamic <A> links make a request from a static web page to software compo-\n\nnents to execute some process. No form data is sent in the request, and the type\nof the HTTP request is always get.\n\n\ufffd Dynamic form links make a request from a form in a static web page by sending\ndata to software components that process the data, using a <FORM> tag. The type\nof HTTP request can be either get or post, as specified in the <method> attribute\nof the <FORM> tag. The data that is submitted via forms impacts the back-end\nprocessing, which is important for testing.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 259\n\n\ufffd Dynamically created HTML is created by web software components, which typ-\nically responds to the user with HTML documents. The contents of the HTML\ndocuments often depend on inputs, which complicates analysis.\n\n\ufffd State-dependent, dynamically created GUIs are HTML pages whose contents\nand form are determined not just by inputs, but by part of the state on the\nserver, such as the date or time, the user, database contents, or session infor-\nmation. The HTML documents can contain Javascript, which are of the web\napplication program that execute on the client. They can also contain links,\nwhich determine the execution of the program. The Javascript and links may\nbe different at different times, which is how different users see different pro-\ngrams.\n# \u301018\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nDynamic analysis techniques are the most promising way to address these\nproblems, however, these problems are why analysis-based techniques are mostly\nconsidered to apply to small structures such as program units.\n\nThe most recent automatic test data generation approach uses search techniques\nsuch as genetic algorithms. Search-based approaches have several advantages, in-\ncluding being easy to implement and being very flexible. They cannot use as much\ninformation as the analysis-based methods, and thus can get stuck on values that\nare hard to find. For example, if a search-based technique is used to achieve edge\ncoverage on a method-level control flow graph, a predicate such as x+y = z presents\ndifficulty for search-based techniques. This problem is compounded if several such\npredicates have to be satisfied to reach a portion of the method. For this reason,\nsearch-based techniques have so far achieved more success at the system level than\nthe unit level.\n\n9.4 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAn excellent, if slightly dated, place to start on software for safety critical systems\nis Leveson\u2019s book [207]. Butler and Finelli wrote a great article on the futility of\nassuring ultra high confidence levels in software via any means, including testing\n[59]. Heimdahl [155] presents a good state-of-the-art perspective on the challenges\nof safety in software intensive systems. McGraw [233] is a good current source for\nthe many issues to consider in building secure software. For a somewhat older treat-\nment, readers might wish to try Rubin [306]. Denning\u2019s book [103] is a classic, al-\nthough it is out of print and hence harder to obtain.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nChallenges in Testing Software 291\n\nCasting the testability problem in terms of controllability and observability\ncomes originally from hardware testing; Friedman [129] and Binder [34] adapted it\nto software testing. Voas [333] developed the three part sensitivity model described\nin this chapter. Applying the testability model in conduction with random testing\nyields an interesting verification argument [334].\n\nOther criteria that we chose to omit are cataloged in a recent book by Pezze and\nYoung [289]. Other references can be found in the research papers cited in previous\nchapters.\n\nA good start for how the Web changes the way software is viewed is a book by\nPowell [292]. Several authors have commented on the inadequacies of subsumption\nfor practical use [149, 340, 344]. We know of four papers that compared data flow\nwith mutation testing [125, 230, 267, 274]. Lots of other papers have appeared that\nempirically compared other test criteria [25, 49, 81, 123, 124, 135, 258, 302, 304, 311,\n327].\n# \u301019\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAnother factor is that the relationships in object-oriented components tend to\nbe very complex. The compositional relationships of inheritance and aggregation,\nespecially when combined with polymorphism, introduce new kinds of faults and\nrequire new methods for testing. This is because the way classes and components\nare integrated is different in object-oriented languages.\n\nObject-oriented languages use classes (data abstraction), inheritance, polymor-\nphism, and dynamic binding to support abstraction. New types created by inheri-\ntance are descendants of the existing type. A class extends its parent class if it in-\ntroduces a new method name and does not override any methods in an ancestor\nclass. (This new method is called an extension method.) A class refines the parent\nclass if it provides new behavior not present in the overridden method, does not call\nthe overridden method, and its behavior is semantically consistent with that of the\noverridden method.\n\nProgrammers use two types of inheritance, subtype and subclass. If class B uses\nsubtype inheritance from class A, then it is possible to freely substitute any instance\nof class B for an instance of A and still satisfy an arbitrary client of class A. This\nis called the substitution principle. In other words, B has an \u201cis-a\u201d relationship with\nA. For example, a chair \u201cis a\u201d special case of a furniture. Subclass inheritance al-\nlows descendant classes to reuse methods and variables from ancestor classes with-\nout necessarily ensuring that instances of the descendants meet the specifications\nof the ancestor type. Although there has been intense discussion of which use of\ninheritance is appropriate, from a tester\u2019s perspective, professional programmers\nuse both types. In the case of subtype inheritance, testers should focus on verifying\nthat the substitution principle holds. The lack of firm guiding principles in subclass\ninheritance provides testers ample opportunities to find faults.\n\nThese abstractions have major effects on component integration. If class B in-\nherits from class A, and both A and B define a method m(), then m() is called a\npolymorphic method. If an object x is declared to be of type A (in Java, \u201cA x;\u201d),\nthen during execution x can have either the actual type A (from \u201cx = new A();\u201d)\nor B (from \u201cx = new B();\u201d). When a call is made to a polymorphic method (for\nexample, \u201cx.m();\u201d), which version is executed depends on the current actual type of\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 237\n\nthe object. The collection of methods that can be executed is called the polymorphic\ncall set (PCS). In this example, the PCS for x.m() is {A::m(), B::m()}.\n\n7.1.1 Unique Issues with Testing OO Software\n\nSeveral testing issues are unique to object-oriented software. Some researchers have\nclaimed that traditional testing techniques are not as effective for object-oriented\nsoftware and sometimes test the wrong things. Methods tend to be smaller and less\ncomplex, so path-based testing techniques may be less useful. As discussed previ-\nously, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding introduce special problems.\nThe execution path is no longer based on the class\u2019s static declared type, but the\ndynamic type; and that is not known until execution.\n\nWhen testing object-oriented software, a class is usually regarded as the basic\nunit of testing. This leads to four levels of testing classes.\n\n1. Intra-method testing: Tests are constructed for individual methods (this is tra-\nditional unit testing)\n\n2. Inter-method testing: Multiple methods within a class are tested in concert\n(this is traditional module testing)\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n\nForman also suggested a way to detect data flow anomalies without running the\nprogram [121].\n\nSome detailed problems with data flow testing have been recurring. These in-\nclude the application of data flow when paths between definitions and uses cannot\nbe executed [127], and handling pointers and arrays [267, 345].\n\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n",

In this example, the PCS for x.m() is {A::m(), B::m()}.\n\n7.1.1 Unique Issues with Testing OO Software\n\nSeveral testing issues are unique to object-oriented software. Some researchers have\nclaimed that traditional testing techniques are not as effective for object-oriented\nsoftware and sometimes test the wrong things. Methods tend to be smaller and less\ncomplex, so path-based testing techniques may be less useful. As discussed previ-\nously, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding introduce special problems.\nThe execution path is no longer based on the class\u2019s static declared type, but the\ndynamic type; and that is not known until execution.\n\nWhen testing object-oriented software, a class is usually regarded as the basic\nunit of testing. This leads to four levels of testing classes.\n\n1. Intra-method testing: Tests are constructed for individual methods (this is tra-\nditional unit testing)\n\n2. Inter-method testing: Multiple methods within a class are tested in concert\n(this is traditional module testing)\n\n3. Intra-class testing: Tests are constructed for a single class, usually as sequences\nof calls to methods within the class\n\n4. Inter-class testing: More than one class is tested at the same time, usually to\nsee how they interact (this is a type of integration testing)\n\nEarly research in object-oriented testing focused on the inter-method and intra-\nclass levels. Later research focused on the testing of interactions between single\nclasses and their users and system-level testing of OO software. Problems associated\nwith inheritance, dynamic binding and polymorphism cannot be addressed at the\ninter-method or intra-class levels. These require multiple classes that are coupled\nthrough inheritance and polymorphism, that is, inter-class testing.\n\nMost research in object-oriented testing has focused on one of two problems.\nOne is the ordering in which classes should be integrated and tested. The CITO\nproblem was discussed in Chapter 6. The other is developing techniques and cov-\nerage criteria for selecting tests. These coverage criteria are refinements of one or\nmore of the criteria presented in the earlier chapters.\n\n7.1.2 Types of Object-Oriented Faults\n\nOne of the hardest tasks for object-oriented software engineers is visualizing the in-\nteractions that can occur in the presence of inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic\nbinding. They are often very complex! This visualization assumes a class encapsu-\nlates state information in a collection of state variables, and has a set of behaviors\nthat are implemented by methods that use those state variables.\n\nAs an example, consider the UML class diagram and code fragment shown\nin Figure 7.1. In the figure, V and X extend W, V overrides method m(), and X\noverrides methods m() and n(). The minuses (\u201c\u2013\u201d) indicate the attributes are pri-\nvate and the pluses (\u201c+\u201d) indicate the attributes are non-private. The declared\ntype of o is W, but at line 10, the actual type can be either V or W. Since V\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n238 Applying Criteria in Practice\n\nW\n\u2212v\n+m()\n+n()\n\n+m()\n+n()\n\nX\n\n+m()\n\nV\n\u2212x\n\n(a ) (b)\n",

The statement\nthat software testing requires up to 50 percent of software development costs is from\nMyers and Sommerville [249, 316]. The recent text from Pezze and Young [289]\nreports relevant processes, principles, and techniques from the testing literature,\nand includes many useful classroom materials. The Pezze and Young text presents\ncoverage criteria in the traditional lifecycle-based manner, and does not organize\ncriteria into the four abstract models discussed in this chapter.\n\nNumerous other software testing books were not intended as textbooks, or do\nnot offer general coverage for classroom use. Beizer\u2019s Software System Testing\nand Quality Assurance [28] and Hetzel\u2019s The Complete Guide to Software Testing\n[160] cover various aspects of management and process for software testing.

Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished.\n",

In 1976,\nMcCabe [232] suggested the same idea on control flow graphs as the primary ap-\nplication of his cyclomatic complexity metric. In 1976, Pimont and Rault [290] sug-\ngested covering pairs of edges, using the term \u201cswitch cover.\u201d In 1978, Chow [77]\nsuggested generating a spanning tree from the FSM and then basing test sequences\non paths through this tree. In 1991, Fujiwara et al. [130] extended Pimont and\nRault\u2019s pairs of edges to arbitrary lengths, and used the term \u201cn-switch\u201d to refer\nto a sequence of edges. He also attributed \u201c1-switch,\u201d or switch cover, to Chow and\ncalled it the \u201cW-method,\u201d an inaccuracy that has been repeated in numerous pa-\npers. The idea of covering pairs of edges was rediscovered in the 1990s. The British\nComputer Society Standard for Software Component Testing called it two-trip [317]\nand Offutt et al. [272], called it transition-pair.\n\nOther test generation methods based on FSMs include tour [251], the distin-\nguished sequence method [137], and unique input-output method [307]. Their ob-\njectives are to detect output errors based on state transitions driven by inputs. FSM-\nbased test generation has been used to test a variety of applications including lex-\nical analyzers, real-time process control software, protocols, data processing, and\ntelephony. One early realization when developing this book is that the criteria for\ncovering FSMs are not substantially different from criteria for other graphs.\n\nThis book has introduced the explicit inclusion of node coverage requirements in\nedge coverage requirements (the \u201cup to\u201d clause). This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n",

Individual programmers are\noften responsible for testing the lowest level components (classes, modules, and\nmethods). After that, testing must be carried out in collaboration with software in-\ntegration. Software can be integrated in many ways. This section discusses technical\nstrategies that must be employed during testing. We do not try to catalog all of them\nfrom a process point of view.\n\nIntegration testing is the testing of incompatibilities and interfaces between oth-\nerwise correctly working components. That is, it is the testing needed to integrate\nsubcomponents into a bigger working component. This is emphatically not the same\nas testing an already integrated component.\n\nThis chapter uses the term software \u201ccomponent\u201d in a very broad sense: A com-\nponent is a piece of a program that can be tested independently of the complete\nprogram or system. Thus, classes, modules, methods, packages, and even code frag-\nments can be considered to be components.\n\nIntegration testing is often done with an incomplete system. The tester may be\nevaluating how only two of many components in the system work together, may be\ntesting integration aspects before the full system is complete, or may be putting the\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n218 Applying Criteria in Practice\n\nsystem together piece by piece and evaluating how each new component fits with\nthe previously integrated components.\n\n6.2.1 Stubs and Drivers\n\nWhen testing incomplete portions of software, developers and testers often need\nextra software components, sometimes called scaffolding. The two most common\ntypes of scaffolding are known as test stubs and test drivers. A test stub is a skeletal\nor special-purpose implementation of a software module, used to develop or test a\ncomponent that calls the stub or otherwise depends on it. It replaces a called com-\nponent. For OO programs, the XP community has developed a version of the stub\ncalled the mock. A mock is a special-purpose replacement class that includes behav-\nior verification to check that a class under test made the correct calls to the mock. A\ntest driver is a software component or test tool that replaces a component that takes\ncare of the control and/or the calling of a software component.\n",

                                    "text": "\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished. This turns out to be\na very simple fault to find during unit testing; indeed analysis showed that almost\nany unit level coverage criterion would have found this multimillion dollar mistake.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n8 Overview\n\nThe Pentium bug not only illustrates the difference in testing levels, but it is also\none of the best arguments for paying more attention to unit testing. There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n",

This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n\nThe notion of subpath sets was developed by Offutt et al. [178, 265] to sup-\nport inter-class path testing and is essentially equivalent to tours with detours as\npresented here. The ideas of touring, sidetrips and detours were introduced by\nAmmann, Offutt and Huang [17].\n\nThe earliest reference we have found on data flow testing was a technical report\nin 1974 by Osterweil and Fosdick [282]. This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n",

Specifi-\ncally, one does not arrive at All-Uses by replacing the notion of \u201cdef\u201d with that of \u201cuse\u201d\nin All-Defs. The reader might find it helpful to note that while All-Defs focuses on defini-\ntions, All-Uses focuses on def-use pairs. While one could argue that the naming convention\nis misleading, and that a name such as \u201cAll-Pairs\u201d might be preferable to All-Uses, the au-\nthors elected to stick with the standard usage in the dataflow literature.\n",

When executing web ap-\nplications, users can break the normal control flow without alerting the \u201cprogram\ncontroller.\u201d The model of program controller that is still taught in basic program-\nming and operating system classes does not exactly apply to web applications be-\ncause the flow of control is distributed across the client and one or more servers.\nUsers can modify the expected control flow on the client by pressing the back or\nrefresh buttons in the browser or by directly modifying the URL in the browser.\nThese interactions introduce unanticipated changes in the execution flow, creating\ncontrol paths cannot be represented with traditional techniques such as control flow\ngraphs. Users can also directly affect data in unpredictable ways, for example, by\nmodifying values of hidden form fields. Furthermore, changes in the client-side con-\nfiguration may affect the behavior of web applications. For example, users can turn\noff cookies, which can cause subsequent operations to malfunction.\n\nThis analysis leads to a number of new connections, which we categorize as fol-\nlows.\n\n\ufffd Traditional static links are represented in HTML with the <A> tag.\n\ufffd Dynamic <A> links make a request from a static web page to software compo-\n\nnents to execute some process. No form data is sent in the request, and the type\nof the HTTP request is always get.\n\n\ufffd Dynamic form links make a request from a form in a static web page by sending\ndata to software components that process the data, using a <FORM> tag. The type\nof HTTP request can be either get or post, as specified in the <method> attribute\nof the <FORM> tag. The data that is submitted via forms impacts the back-end\nprocessing, which is important for testing.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 259\n\n\ufffd Dynamically created HTML is created by web software components, which typ-\nically responds to the user with HTML documents.

Search-based approaches have several advantages, in-\ncluding being easy to implement and being very flexible. They cannot use as much\ninformation as the analysis-based methods, and thus can get stuck on values that\nare hard to find. For example, if a search-based technique is used to achieve edge\ncoverage on a method-level control flow graph, a predicate such as x+y = z presents\ndifficulty for search-based techniques. This problem is compounded if several such\npredicates have to be satisfied to reach a portion of the method.

Butler and Finelli wrote a great article on the futility of\nassuring ultra high confidence levels in software via any means, including testing\n[59]. Heimdahl [155] presents a good state-of-the-art perspective on the challenges\nof safety in software intensive systems. McGraw [233] is a good current source for\nthe many issues to consider in building secure software. For a somewhat older treat-\nment, readers might wish to try Rubin [306]. Denning\u2019s book [103] is a classic, al-\nthough it is out of print and hence harder to obtain.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nChallenges in Testing Software 291\n\nCasting the testability problem in terms of controllability and observability\ncomes originally from hardware testing; Friedman [129] and Binder [34] adapted it\nto software testing. Voas [333] developed the three part sensitivity model described\nin this chapter. Applying the testability model in conduction with random testing\nyields an interesting verification argument [334].\n\nOther criteria that we chose to omit are cataloged in a recent book by Pezze and\nYoung [289]. Other references can be found in the research papers cited in previous\nchapters.\n\nA good start for how the Web changes the way software is viewed is a book by\nPowell [292]. Several authors have commented on the inadequacies of subsumption\nfor practical use [149, 340, 344]. We know of four papers that compared data flow\nwith mutation testing [125, 230, 267, 274]. Lots of other papers have appeared that\nempirically compared other test criteria [25, 49, 81, 123, 124, 135, 258, 302, 304, 311,\n327].\n",

The compositional relationships of inheritance and aggregation,\nespecially when combined with polymorphism, introduce new kinds of faults and\nrequire new methods for testing. This is because the way classes and components\nare integrated is different in object-oriented languages.\n\nObject-oriented languages use classes (data abstraction), inheritance, polymor-\nphism, and dynamic binding to support abstraction. New types created by inheri-\ntance are descendants of the existing type. A class extends its parent class if it in-\ntroduces a new method name and does not override any methods in an ancestor\nclass. (This new method is called an extension method.) A class refines the parent\nclass if it provides new behavior not present in the overridden method, does not call\nthe overridden method, and its behavior is semantically consistent with that of the\noverridden method.\n\nProgrammers use two types of inheritance, subtype and subclass. If class B uses\nsubtype inheritance from class A, then it is possible to freely substitute any instance\nof class B for an instance of A and still satisfy an arbitrary client of class A. This\nis called the substitution principle. In other words, B has an \u201cis-a\u201d relationship with\nA. For example, a chair \u201cis a\u201d special case of a furniture. Subclass inheritance al-\nlows descendant classes to reuse methods and variables from ancestor classes with-\nout necessarily ensuring that instances of the descendants meet the specifications\nof the ancestor type. Although there has been intense discussion of which use of\ninheritance is appropriate, from a tester\u2019s perspective, professional programmers\nuse both types. In the case of subtype inheritance, testers should focus on verifying\nthat the substitution principle holds. The lack of firm guiding principles in subclass\ninheritance provides testers ample opportunities to find faults.\n\nThese abstractions have major effects on component integration. If class B in-\nherits from class A, and both A and B define a method m(), then m() is called a\npolymorphic method. If an object x is declared to be of type A (in Java, \u201cA x;\u201d),\nthen during execution x can have either the actual type A (from \u201cx = new A();\u201d)\nor B (from \u201cx = new B();\u201d). When a call is made to a polymorphic method (for\nexample, \u201cx.m();\u201d), which version is executed depends on the current actual type of\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 237\n\nthe object. The collection of methods that can be executed is called the polymorphic\ncall set (PCS). In this example, the PCS for x.m() is {A::m(), B::m()}.\n\n7.1.1 Unique Issues with Testing OO Software\n\nSeveral testing issues are unique to object-oriented software. Some researchers have\nclaimed that traditional testing techniques are not as effective for object-oriented\nsoftware and sometimes test the wrong things. Methods tend to be smaller and less\ncomplex, so path-based testing techniques may be less useful. As discussed previ-\nously, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding introduce special problems.\nThe execution path is no longer based on the class\u2019s static declared type, but the\ndynamic type; and that is not known until execution.\n\nWhen testing object-oriented software, a class is usually regarded as the basic\nunit of testing. This leads to four levels of testing classes.\n\n1. Intra-method testing: Tests are constructed for individual methods (this is tra-\nditional unit testing)\n\n2. Inter-method testing: Multiple methods within a class are tested in concert\n(this is traditional module testing)\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n\nForman also suggested a way to detect data flow anomalies without running the\nprogram [121].\n\nSome detailed problems with data flow testing have been recurring. These in-\nclude the application of data flow when paths between definitions and uses cannot\nbe executed [127], and handling pointers and arrays [267, 345].\n\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n# \u30103\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[117] Roger Ferguson and Bogdan Korel.

Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n\nCoupling was first discussed as a design metric by Constantine and Yourdon [88],\nand its use for testing was introduced implicitly by Harrold, Soffa, and Rothermel\n[152, 154] and explicitly by Jin and Offutt [178], who introduced the use of first-uses\nand last-defs.\n\nKim, Hong, Cho, Bae, and Cha used a graph-based approach to generate tests\nfrom UML state diagrams [186].\n\nThe USA\u2019s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has recognized the increased\nimportance of modularity and integration testing by imposing requirements on\nstructural coverage analysis of software that \u201cthe analysis should confirm the data\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 103\n\ncoupling and control coupling between the code components\u201d [305], p. 33, section\n6.4.4.2.\n\nData flow testing has also been applied to integration testing by Harrold and\nSoffa [154], Harrold and Rothermel [152], and Jin and Offutt [178].

Data flow testing has been applied to inheritance and polymorphism in\nobject-oriented software by Alexander and Offutt [11, 10, 12], and Buy, Orso, and\nPezze [60, 281].

The collection of methods that can be executed is called the polymorphic\ncall set (PCS). In this example, the PCS for x.m() is {A::m(), B::m()}.\n\n7.1.1 Unique Issues with Testing OO Software\n\nSeveral testing issues are unique to object-oriented software. Some researchers have\nclaimed that traditional testing techniques are not as effective for object-oriented\nsoftware and sometimes test the wrong things. Methods tend to be smaller and less\ncomplex, so path-based testing techniques may be less useful. As discussed previ-\nously, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding introduce special problems.\nThe execution path is no longer based on the class\u2019s static declared type, but the\ndynamic type; and that is not known until execution.\n\nWhen testing object-oriented software, a class is usually regarded as the basic\nunit of testing. This leads to four levels of testing classes.\n\n1. Intra-method testing: Tests are constructed for individual methods (this is tra-\nditional unit testing)\n\n2. Inter-method testing: Multiple methods within a class are tested in concert\n(this is traditional module testing)\n\n3. Intra-class testing: Tests are constructed for a single class, usually as sequences\nof calls to methods within the class\n\n4. Inter-class testing: More than one class is tested at the same time, usually to\nsee how they interact (this is a type of integration testing)\n\nEarly research in object-oriented testing focused on the inter-method and intra-\nclass levels. Later research focused on the testing of interactions between single\nclasses and their users and system-level testing of OO software. Problems associated\nwith inheritance, dynamic binding and polymorphism cannot be addressed at the\ninter-method or intra-class levels. These require multiple classes that are coupled\nthrough inheritance and polymorphism, that is, inter-class testing.\n\nMost research in object-oriented testing has focused on one of two problems.\nOne is the ordering in which classes should be integrated and tested. The CITO\nproblem was discussed in Chapter 6. The other is developing techniques and cov-\nerage criteria for selecting tests. These coverage criteria are refinements of one or\nmore of the criteria presented in the earlier chapters.\n\n7.1.2 Types of Object-Oriented Faults\n\nOne of the hardest tasks for object-oriented software engineers is visualizing the in-\nteractions that can occur in the presence of inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic\nbinding. They are often very complex! This visualization assumes a class encapsu-\nlates state information in a collection of state variables, and has a set of behaviors\nthat are implemented by methods that use those state variables.\n\nAs an example, consider the UML class diagram and code fragment shown\nin Figure 7.1. In the figure, V and X extend W, V overrides method m(), and X\noverrides methods m() and n(). The minuses (\u201c\u2013\u201d) indicate the attributes are pri-\nvate and the pluses (\u201c+\u201d) indicate the attributes are non-private. The declared\ntype of o is W, but at line 10, the actual type can be either V or W. Since V\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n238 Applying Criteria in Practice\n\nW\n\u2212v\n+m()\n+n()\n\n+m()\n+n()\n\nX\n\n+m()\n\nV\n\u2212x\n\n(a ) (b)\n# \u30106\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[109] Elfriede Dustin, Jeff Rashka, and John Paul.

The statement\nthat software testing requires up to 50 percent of software development costs is from\nMyers and Sommerville [249, 316]. The recent text from Pezze and Young [289]\nreports relevant processes, principles, and techniques from the testing literature,\nand includes many useful classroom materials. The Pezze and Young text presents\ncoverage criteria in the traditional lifecycle-based manner, and does not organize\ncriteria into the four abstract models discussed in this chapter.\n\nNumerous other software testing books were not intended as textbooks, or do\nnot offer general coverage for classroom use. Beizer\u2019s Software System Testing\nand Quality Assurance [28] and Hetzel\u2019s The Complete Guide to Software Testing\n[160] cover various aspects of management and process for software testing. Several\nbooks cover specific aspects of testing [169, 227, 301].

Unit testing is designed to assess the units produced by the implementation\nphase and is the \u201clowest\u201d level of testing. In some cases, such as when building\ngeneral-purpose library modules, unit testing is done without knowledge of the en-\ncapsulating software application. As with module testing, most software develop-\nment organizations make unit testing the responsibility of the programmer. It is\nstraightforward to package unit tests together with the corresponding code through\nthe use of tools such as JUnit for Java classes.\n\nNot shown in Figure 1.2 is regression testing, a standard part of the mainte-\nnance phase of software development. Regression testing is testing that is done after\nchanges are made to the software, and its purpose is to help ensure that the updated\nsoftware still possesses the functionality it had before the updates.\n\nMistakes in requirements and high-level design wind up being implemented as\nfaults in the program; thus testing can reveal them. Unfortunately, the software\nfaults that come from requirements and design mistakes are visible only through\ntesting months or years after the original mistake. The effects of the mistake tend\nto be dispersed throughout multiple software components; hence such faults are\nusually difficult to pin down and expensive to correct. On the positive side, even if\ntests cannot be executed, the very process of defining tests can identify a significant\nfraction of the mistakes in requirements and design. Hence, it is important for test\nplanning to proceed concurrently with requirements analysis and design and not\nbe put off until late in a project. Fortunately, through techniques such as use-case\nanalysis, test planning is becoming better integrated with requirements analysis in\nstandard software practice.\n\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from. For example, unit and module tests are derived\nto test units and modules, and we usually try to find faults that can be found when\nexecuting the units and modules individually.\n\nOne of the best examples of the differences between unit testing and system\ntesting can be illustrated in the context of the infamous Pentium bug. In 1994, Intel\nintroduced its Pentium microprocessor, and a few months later, Thomas Nicely, a\nmathematician at Lynchburg College in Virginia, found that the chip gave incorrect\nanswers to certain floating-point division calculations.\n\nThe chip was slightly inaccurate for a few pairs of numbers; Intel claimed (proba-\nbly correctly) that only one in nine billion division operations would exhibit reduced\nprecision. The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished.\n# \u30109\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nBibliography 303\n\n[124] Phyllis G.

In 1976,\nMcCabe [232] suggested the same idea on control flow graphs as the primary ap-\nplication of his cyclomatic complexity metric. In 1976, Pimont and Rault [290] sug-\ngested covering pairs of edges, using the term \u201cswitch cover.\u201d In 1978, Chow [77]\nsuggested generating a spanning tree from the FSM and then basing test sequences\non paths through this tree. In 1991, Fujiwara et al. [130] extended Pimont and\nRault\u2019s pairs of edges to arbitrary lengths, and used the term \u201cn-switch\u201d to refer\nto a sequence of edges. He also attributed \u201c1-switch,\u201d or switch cover, to Chow and\ncalled it the \u201cW-method,\u201d an inaccuracy that has been repeated in numerous pa-\npers. The idea of covering pairs of edges was rediscovered in the 1990s. The British\nComputer Society Standard for Software Component Testing called it two-trip [317]\nand Offutt et al. [272], called it transition-pair.\n\nOther test generation methods based on FSMs include tour [251], the distin-\nguished sequence method [137], and unique input-output method [307]. Their ob-\njectives are to detect output errors based on state transitions driven by inputs. FSM-\nbased test generation has been used to test a variety of applications including lex-\nical analyzers, real-time process control software, protocols, data processing, and\ntelephony. One early realization when developing this book is that the criteria for\ncovering FSMs are not substantially different from criteria for other graphs.\n\nThis book has introduced the explicit inclusion of node coverage requirements in\nedge coverage requirements (the \u201cup to\u201d clause). This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n# \u301011\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nSe-\nlection techniques include linear equations, symbolic execution, path analysis, data\nflow analysis, program dependence graphs, system dependence graphs, modification\nanalysis, firewall definition, cluster identification, slicing, graph walks, and modified\nentity analysis. For example, as a reader of Chapter 2 might guess, data flow selec-\ntion techniques choose tests only if they touch new, modified, or deleted DU pairs;\nother tests are omitted.\n\nA selection technique is inclusive to the degree that it includes tests that are\n\u201cmodification-revealing.\u201d Unsafe techniques have inclusiveness of less than 100%.\nA technique is precise to the extent that it omits regression tests that are not\nmodification-revealing. A technique is efficient to the degree that determine the\nappropriate subset of the regression test set is less computationally intensive than\nsimply executing the omitted tests. Finally, a technique is general to the degree that\napplies to a wide variety of practical situations. To continue the example, the data\nflow approach to selecting regression tests is not necessarily either safe or precise, of\npolynomial complexity in certain program attributes, and requires, obviously, data\nflow information and program instrumentation at the data flow graph level. The bib-\nliographic notes section contains pointers to further details on this work, including\nempirical evaluations.\n\n6.2 INTEGRATION AND TESTING\n\nSoftware is composed of many pieces of varying sizes. Individual programmers are\noften responsible for testing the lowest level components (classes, modules, and\nmethods). After that, testing must be carried out in collaboration with software in-\ntegration. Software can be integrated in many ways. This section discusses technical\nstrategies that must be employed during testing. We do not try to catalog all of them\nfrom a process point of view.\n\nIntegration testing is the testing of incompatibilities and interfaces between oth-\nerwise correctly working components. That is, it is the testing needed to integrate\nsubcomponents into a bigger working component. This is emphatically not the same\nas testing an already integrated component.\n\nThis chapter uses the term software \u201ccomponent\u201d in a very broad sense: A com-\nponent is a piece of a program that can be tested independently of the complete\nprogram or system. Thus, classes, modules, methods, packages, and even code frag-\nments can be considered to be components.\n\nIntegration testing is often done with an incomplete system. The tester may be\nevaluating how only two of many components in the system work together, may be\ntesting integration aspects before the full system is complete, or may be putting the\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n218 Applying Criteria in Practice\n\nsystem together piece by piece and evaluating how each new component fits with\nthe previously integrated components.\n\n6.2.1 Stubs and Drivers\n\nWhen testing incomplete portions of software, developers and testers often need\nextra software components, sometimes called scaffolding. The two most common\ntypes of scaffolding are known as test stubs and test drivers. A test stub is a skeletal\nor special-purpose implementation of a software module, used to develop or test a\ncomponent that calls the stub or otherwise depends on it. It replaces a called com-\nponent. For OO programs, the XP community has developed a version of the stub\ncalled the mock. A mock is a special-purpose replacement class that includes behav-\nior verification to check that a class under test made the correct calls to the mock. A\ntest driver is a software component or test tool that replaces a component that takes\ncare of the control and/or the calling of a software component.\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAlthough most of the literature emphasizes these levels in terms of when they\nare applied, a more important distinction is on the types of faults that we are looking\nfor. The faults are based on the software artifact that we are testing, and the software\nartifact that we derive the tests from.

The fault was the omission of five entries in a table of 1,066 values (part\nof the chip\u2019s circuitry) used by a division algorithm. The five entries should have\ncontained the constant +2, but the entries were not initialized and contained zero\ninstead. The MIT mathematician Edelman claimed that \u201cthe bug in the Pentium was\nan easy mistake to make, and a difficult one to catch,\u201d an analysis that misses one\nof the essential points. This was a very difficult mistake to find during system test-\ning, and indeed, Intel claimed to have run millions of tests using this table. But the\ntable entries were left empty because a loop termination condition was incorrect;\nthat is, the loop stopped storing numbers before it was finished. This turns out to be\na very simple fault to find during unit testing; indeed analysis showed that almost\nany unit level coverage criterion would have found this multimillion dollar mistake.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n8 Overview\n\nThe Pentium bug not only illustrates the difference in testing levels, but it is also\none of the best arguments for paying more attention to unit testing. There are no\nshortcuts \u2013 all aspects of software need to be tested.\n\nOn the other hand, some faults can only be found at the system level. One dra-\nmatic example was the launch failure of the first Ariane 5 rocket, which exploded\n37 seconds after liftoff on June 4, 1996. The low-level cause was an unhandled\nfloating-point conversion exception in an internal guidance system function. It\nturned out that the guidance system could never encounter the unhandled exception\nwhen used on the Ariane 4 rocket. In other words, the guidance system function is\ncorrect for Ariane 4. The developers of the Ariane 5 quite reasonably wanted to\nreuse the successful inertial guidance system from the Ariane 4, but no one reana-\nlyzed the software in light of the substantially different flight trajectory of Ariane 5.\nFurthermore, the system tests that would have found the problem were technically\ndifficult to execute, and so were not performed. The result was spectacular \u2013 and\nexpensive!\n\nAnother public failure was the Mars lander of September 1999, which crashed\ndue to a misunderstanding in the units of measure used by two modules created by\nseparate software groups. One module computed thruster data in English units and\nforwarded the data to a module that expected data in metric units. This is a very\ntypical integration fault (but in this case enormously expensive, both in terms of\nmoney and prestige).\n# \u301013\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[360] Ye Wu, Jeff Offutt, and Xiaochen Du.

This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n\nThe notion of subpath sets was developed by Offutt et al. [178, 265] to sup-\nport inter-class path testing and is essentially equivalent to tours with detours as\npresented here. The ideas of touring, sidetrips and detours were introduced by\nAmmann, Offutt and Huang [17].\n\nThe earliest reference we have found on data flow testing was a technical report\nin 1974 by Osterweil and Fosdick [282]. This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n# \u301015\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFull inter-procedural data flow identifies all du-pairs between a caller (A()) and\na callee (B()). Coupling inter-procedural data flow is as described in Section 2.4.2;\nidentifying du-pairs between last-defs and first-uses.\n\nFigure 2.30 illustrates du-pairs in object-oriented software. DU pairs are usu-\nally based on the class or state variables defined for the class. The left picture in\nFigure 2.30 shows the \u201cdirect\u201d case for OO du-pairs.

For the variable\nreference to be the same, both A() and B() must be called through the same instance\ncontext, or object reference. That is, if the calls are o.A() and o.B(), they are called\nthrough the instance context of o. If the calls are not made through the same instance\ncontext, the definition and use will be to different instances of the variable.\n\nThe right side of Figure 2.30 illustrates \u201cindirect\u201d du-pairs. In this scenario, the\ncoupling method F() calls two methods, M() and N(), which in turn call two other\nmethods, A() and B(). The def and use are in A() and B(), so the reference is indirect.\nThe analysis for indirect du-pairs is considerably more complicated than for direct\ndu-pairs. It should be obvious that there can be more than one call between the\ncoupling method and the methods with the def and use.\n\nIn OO data flow testing, the methods A() and B() could be in the same class, or\nthey could be in different classes and accessing the same global variables.\n\nFinally, Figure 2.31 illustrates du-pairs in distributed software. P1 and P2 are two\nprocesses, threads, or other distributed software components, and they call A() and\nB(), which def and use the same variable. The distribution and communication could\nuse any of a number of methods, including HTTP (Web-based), remote method\ninvocation (RMI), or CORBA. A() and B() could be in the same class or could access\na persistent variable such as a Web session variable or permanent data store. While\nthis sort of \u201cvery loosely coupled\u201d software can be expected to have far fewer du-\npairs, identifying them, finding def-clear paths between them, and designing test\ncases to cover them is quite complicated.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.4.\n# \u301016\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nKim, Hong, Cho, Bae, and Cha used a graph-based approach to generate tests\nfrom UML state diagrams [186].\n\nThe USA\u2019s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has recognized the increased\nimportance of modularity and integration testing by imposing requirements on\nstructural coverage analysis of software that \u201cthe analysis should confirm the data\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 103\n\ncoupling and control coupling between the code components\u201d [305], p. 33, section\n6.4.4.2.\n\nData flow testing has also been applied to integration testing by Harrold and\nSoffa [154], Harrold and Rothermel [152], and Jin and Offutt [178]. This work\nfocused on class-level integration issues, but did not address inheritance or poly-\nmorphism. Data flow testing has been applied to inheritance and polymorphism in\nobject-oriented software by Alexander and Offutt [11, 10, 12], and Buy, Orso, and\nPezze [60, 281]. Gallagher and Offutt modeled classes as interacting state machines,\nand tested concurrency and communication issues among them [132].\n\nSCR was first discussed by Henninger [157], and its use in model checking and\ntesting was introduced by Atlee [20].\n\nConstructing tests from UML diagrams is a more recent development, though\nrelatively straightforward. It was first suggested by Abdurazik and Offutt [2, 264],\nand soon followed by Briand and Labiche [45].\n\nThe mechanisms for turning finite automata into regular expressions are stan-\ndard fare in CS theory classes. As far as we know, Beizer [29] was the first to note\nthe utility of these transformations in the testing context.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 By way of example, typical control flow graphs have very few, if any, syntactically unreach-\nable nodes, but call graphs, especially for object-oriented programs, often do.\n\n2 Our mathematician readers might notice that this definition is constructive in that it defines\nwhat is in the set TR, but does not actually bound the set. It is certainly our intention that\nTR contains no other elements.\n\n3 The reader might wonder why NOTFOUND fails to appear in the set use(2). The reason, as\nexplained in Section 2.3.2 is that the use is local.\n\n4 The reader is cautioned that despite the names of the criteria, All-Defs and All-Uses are\nnot complementary criteria with respect to how they tread definitions and uses. Specifi-\ncally, one does not arrive at All-Uses by replacing the notion of \u201cdef\u201d with that of \u201cuse\u201d\nin All-Defs. The reader might find it helpful to note that while All-Defs focuses on defini-\ntions, All-Uses focuses on def-use pairs. While one could argue that the naming convention\nis misleading, and that a name such as \u201cAll-Pairs\u201d might be preferable to All-Uses, the au-\nthors elected to stick with the standard usage in the dataflow literature.\n# \u301017\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nBypass testing creates inputs that intentionally violate these validation rules and\nconstraints, then submits the inputs directly to the web application without letting\nthe web page validate them.\n\nA limitation of both these approaches comes from the fact that finding all the\nscreens in a web application is undecidable. They rely on heuristic searches to try\nto identify all screens, but if some screens only appear when certain rare inputs are\nprovided, it may be very difficult to find them. Server-side approaches may have the\nability to look at program source, and therefore find more potential screens.\n\nServer-Side Testing of Web Applications\nWeb software applications allow changes in the control of execution of the applica-\ntion that do not appear in traditional software. In traditional programs, the control\nflow is fully managed by the program, so the tester can only affect it through test\ninputs. Web applications do not have this same property. When executing web ap-\nplications, users can break the normal control flow without alerting the \u201cprogram\ncontroller.\u201d The model of program controller that is still taught in basic program-\nming and operating system classes does not exactly apply to web applications be-\ncause the flow of control is distributed across the client and one or more servers.\nUsers can modify the expected control flow on the client by pressing the back or\nrefresh buttons in the browser or by directly modifying the URL in the browser.\nThese interactions introduce unanticipated changes in the execution flow, creating\ncontrol paths cannot be represented with traditional techniques such as control flow\ngraphs. Users can also directly affect data in unpredictable ways, for example, by\nmodifying values of hidden form fields. Furthermore, changes in the client-side con-\nfiguration may affect the behavior of web applications. For example, users can turn\noff cookies, which can cause subsequent operations to malfunction.\n\nThis analysis leads to a number of new connections, which we categorize as fol-\nlows.\n\n\ufffd Traditional static links are represented in HTML with the <A> tag.\n\ufffd Dynamic <A> links make a request from a static web page to software compo-\n\nnents to execute some process. No form data is sent in the request, and the type\nof the HTTP request is always get.\n\n\ufffd Dynamic form links make a request from a form in a static web page by sending\ndata to software components that process the data, using a <FORM> tag. The type\nof HTTP request can be either get or post, as specified in the <method> attribute\nof the <FORM> tag. The data that is submitted via forms impacts the back-end\nprocessing, which is important for testing.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 259\n\n\ufffd Dynamically created HTML is created by web software components, which typ-\nically responds to the user with HTML documents. The contents of the HTML\ndocuments often depend on inputs, which complicates analysis.\n\n\ufffd State-dependent, dynamically created GUIs are HTML pages whose contents\nand form are determined not just by inputs, but by part of the state on the\nserver, such as the date or time, the user, database contents, or session infor-\nmation. The HTML documents can contain Javascript, which are of the web\napplication program that execute on the client. They can also contain links,\nwhich determine the execution of the program. The Javascript and links may\nbe different at different times, which is how different users see different pro-\ngrams.\n# \u301018\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nDynamic analysis techniques are the most promising way to address these\nproblems, however, these problems are why analysis-based techniques are mostly\nconsidered to apply to small structures such as program units.\n\nThe most recent automatic test data generation approach uses search techniques\nsuch as genetic algorithms. Search-based approaches have several advantages, in-\ncluding being easy to implement and being very flexible. They cannot use as much\ninformation as the analysis-based methods, and thus can get stuck on values that\nare hard to find. For example, if a search-based technique is used to achieve edge\ncoverage on a method-level control flow graph, a predicate such as x+y = z presents\ndifficulty for search-based techniques. This problem is compounded if several such\npredicates have to be satisfied to reach a portion of the method. For this reason,\nsearch-based techniques have so far achieved more success at the system level than\nthe unit level.\n\n9.4 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAn excellent, if slightly dated, place to start on software for safety critical systems\nis Leveson\u2019s book [207]. Butler and Finelli wrote a great article on the futility of\nassuring ultra high confidence levels in software via any means, including testing\n[59]. Heimdahl [155] presents a good state-of-the-art perspective on the challenges\nof safety in software intensive systems. McGraw [233] is a good current source for\nthe many issues to consider in building secure software. For a somewhat older treat-\nment, readers might wish to try Rubin [306]. Denning\u2019s book [103] is a classic, al-\nthough it is out of print and hence harder to obtain.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nChallenges in Testing Software 291\n\nCasting the testability problem in terms of controllability and observability\ncomes originally from hardware testing; Friedman [129] and Binder [34] adapted it\nto software testing. Voas [333] developed the three part sensitivity model described\nin this chapter. Applying the testability model in conduction with random testing\nyields an interesting verification argument [334].\n\nOther criteria that we chose to omit are cataloged in a recent book by Pezze and\nYoung [289]. Other references can be found in the research papers cited in previous\nchapters.\n\nA good start for how the Web changes the way software is viewed is a book by\nPowell [292]. Several authors have commented on the inadequacies of subsumption\nfor practical use [149, 340, 344]. We know of four papers that compared data flow\nwith mutation testing [125, 230, 267, 274]. Lots of other papers have appeared that\nempirically compared other test criteria [25, 49, 81, 123, 124, 135, 258, 302, 304, 311,\n327].\n# \u301019\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAnother factor is that the relationships in object-oriented components tend to\nbe very complex. The compositional relationships of inheritance and aggregation,\nespecially when combined with polymorphism, introduce new kinds of faults and\nrequire new methods for testing. This is because the way classes and components\nare integrated is different in object-oriented languages.\n\nObject-oriented languages use classes (data abstraction), inheritance, polymor-\nphism, and dynamic binding to support abstraction. New types created by inheri-\ntance are descendants of the existing type. A class extends its parent class if it in-\ntroduces a new method name and does not override any methods in an ancestor\nclass. (This new method is called an extension method.) A class refines the parent\nclass if it provides new behavior not present in the overridden method, does not call\nthe overridden method, and its behavior is semantically consistent with that of the\noverridden method.\n\nProgrammers use two types of inheritance, subtype and subclass. If class B uses\nsubtype inheritance from class A, then it is possible to freely substitute any instance\nof class B for an instance of A and still satisfy an arbitrary client of class A. This\nis called the substitution principle. In other words, B has an \u201cis-a\u201d relationship with\nA. For example, a chair \u201cis a\u201d special case of a furniture. Subclass inheritance al-\nlows descendant classes to reuse methods and variables from ancestor classes with-\nout necessarily ensuring that instances of the descendants meet the specifications\nof the ancestor type. Although there has been intense discussion of which use of\ninheritance is appropriate, from a tester\u2019s perspective, professional programmers\nuse both types. In the case of subtype inheritance, testers should focus on verifying\nthat the substitution principle holds. The lack of firm guiding principles in subclass\ninheritance provides testers ample opportunities to find faults.\n\nThese abstractions have major effects on component integration. If class B in-\nherits from class A, and both A and B define a method m(), then m() is called a\npolymorphic method. If an object x is declared to be of type A (in Java, \u201cA x;\u201d),\nthen during execution x can have either the actual type A (from \u201cx = new A();\u201d)\nor B (from \u201cx = new B();\u201d). When a call is made to a polymorphic method (for\nexample, \u201cx.m();\u201d), which version is executed depends on the current actual type of\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 237\n\nthe object. The collection of methods that can be executed is called the polymorphic\ncall set (PCS). In this example, the PCS for x.m() is {A::m(), B::m()}.\n\n7.1.1 Unique Issues with Testing OO Software\n\nSeveral testing issues are unique to object-oriented software. Some researchers have\nclaimed that traditional testing techniques are not as effective for object-oriented\nsoftware and sometimes test the wrong things. Methods tend to be smaller and less\ncomplex, so path-based testing techniques may be less useful. As discussed previ-\nously, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding introduce special problems.\nThe execution path is no longer based on the class\u2019s static declared type, but the\ndynamic type; and that is not known until execution.\n\nWhen testing object-oriented software, a class is usually regarded as the basic\nunit of testing. This leads to four levels of testing classes.\n\n1. Intra-method testing: Tests are constructed for individual methods (this is tra-\nditional unit testing)\n\n2. Inter-method testing: Multiple methods within a class are tested in concert\n(this is traditional module testing)\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

                            "Great! Let\u2019s now cover the most important subtopic in dynamic unit testing:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Topic 3: **Dynamic Unit Testing Techniques**\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Textbook Context**:  \nThese techniques are introduced in **Chapters 2\u20134**, where the authors detail how to apply them during unit testing, using coverage criteria. For Module 2, we introduce them **briefly** with examples, and go deeper in Module 3 & 4.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f What is Dynamic Unit Testing?\n\n> Running the program with **selected inputs** to exercise internal code paths, branches, or data flows.  \nMain goal: **Observe actual behavior** and detect faults.\n\n---\n\n### The **4 Dynamic Testing Techniques** for CST458:\n\n| Technique | What it Focuses On | Detailed in |\n|-----------|--------------------|-------------|\n| **Control Flow Testing** | Execution paths through code | Ch. 2 |\n| **Data Flow Testing** | Definition/use of variables | Ch. 3 |\n| **Domain Testing** | Partitioning input space | Ch. 4 |\n| **Functional Program Testing** | Input/output behavior | Ch. 1 & Ch. 4 |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd38 1. Control Flow Testing\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Ch. 2, Page 27 onward**  \nTests **paths** in the control flow graph (CFG) of the program.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Key Concepts:\n- **Nodes** = statements\n- **Edges** = control flow\n- **Test Criteria**: Statement coverage, branch coverage, path coverage\n\n### \u2705 Example:\n\n```java\nif (x > 0)\n    y = 1;\nelse\n    y = -1;\n```\n\n- **Branch Coverage**: One test for `x > 0`, one for `x \u2264 0`\n- Ensures **both branches are tested**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd38 2. Data Flow Testing\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Ch. 3, Page 89 onward**  \nFocuses on how variables are defined and used.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Key Terms:\n- **Def**: where variable is assigned\n- **Use**: where it\u2019s read\n- **DU-Pairs**: Def-Use pairs\n- **Test requirement**: Cover important DU-pairs\n\n### \u2705 Example:\n\n```java\nint x = 5;     // def\nint y = x + 2; // use of x\n```\n\n> We test paths that carry value of `x` from its **definition** to its **use**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd38 3. Domain Testing\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Ch. 4, Page 153 onward**  \nAlso called **Input Space Partitioning (ISP)**.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Core Idea:\n- Inputs are partitioned into **domains or blocks**\n- Select **representative values** from each block\n- Includes testing of **boundary values** and **invalid domains**\n\n### \u2705 Example:\nIf `age` must be in 0\u2013100:\n- Valid domain: 25, 99\n- Invalid: -1, 101\n- Boundary: 0, 100\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd38 4. Functional Program Testing\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 Covered throughout textbook (esp. Ch. 1, 4)\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Goal:\n- Match **input-output behavior** to **specification**\n- Often used in **black-box testing** or **unit testing from requirements**\n\n### \u2705 Example:\nFunction: `int square(int x)`  \nTest with: `square(2) \u2192 4`, `square(-3) \u2192 9`  \nCheck whether results conform to specs.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Summary Table\n\n| Technique              | Focus                    | Method |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|--------|\n| Control Flow Testing   | Execution paths (CFG)    | Statement/branch/path coverage |\n| Data Flow Testing      | Variable usage & flow    | DU-pairs |\n| Domain Testing         | Input values & partitions| ISP, boundary testing |\n| Functional Program Testing | Spec-conformance     | Input/output behavior |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf93 CST458 Exam Tips\n\n- **Part A (3 marks)**:  \n  - \u201cDefine control flow testing.\u201d  \n  - \u201cWhat is domain testing?\u201d  \n- **Part B (14 marks)**:  \n  - \"Explain different dynamic testing techniques.\"  \n  - Include examples, code snippets, and diagrams for CFG or input domains.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Pro Tip**: Diagrams like CFGs or input space boxes boost clarity and score.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd16 Page Reference Summary\n\n| Concept                  | Page |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Control Flow Testing     | Page 27\u201350 (Ch. 2) |\n| Data Flow Testing        | Page 89\u2013118 (Ch. 3) |\n| Domain Testing (ISP)     | Page 153\u2013180 (Ch. 4) |\n| Functional Program Testing | Pages 13\u201314 (ex: `numZero`) & Ch. 4 |\n\n---\n\nNext up:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Mutation Testing \u2013 Mutation Operators, Mutants, Mutation Score** \u2014 shall we proceed?"

                            "Great! Now we\u2019ll explore a **core topic** in Unit Testing and a common **Part B essay question**:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Topic 4: **Mutation Testing**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Textbook Reference**:  \n- **Chapter 5: Mutation Testing**, Pages **199\u2013222**  \n- Especially useful when combined with **JUnit** and **MuClipse** tools in practical scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What is Mutation Testing?\n\n> Mutation testing is a **fault-based testing technique** where small changes (mutations) are made to a program\u2019s source code to create **mutants**, and the effectiveness of test cases is evaluated based on whether they can detect the changes.\n\n\ud83d\udccd **Page 200, Definition 5.1**:  \n> **Mutant**: A copy of the original program with one small syntactic change.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Purpose\n\n- Measure the **effectiveness of a test suite**.\n- Reveal **weak test cases** that fail to detect small faults.\n- Encourage development of **stronger, fault-revealing** test cases.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd38 Key Concepts in Mutation Testing\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc 1. Mutation and Mutants\n\n- **Original Program** \u2192 Apply a small change \u2192 **Mutant**\n- Each mutant has **one small change** (fault).\n- You then **run existing test cases** against mutants.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc 2. Mutation Operators\n\n\ud83d\udccd **Page 201, Table 5.1** lists common mutation operators:\n\n| Operator Type | Example |\n|---------------|---------|\n| **Arithmetic Operator Replacement** | `+` \u2192 `-` |\n| **Relational Operator Replacement** | `>` \u2192 `>=` |\n| **Logical Connector Replacement** | `&&` \u2192 `||` |\n| **Constant Replacement** | `0` \u2192 `1` |\n| **Statement Deletion** | Remove a line of code |\n\n\ud83e\udde0 These simulate **typical coding errors** that developers make.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc 3. Killing Mutants\n\n- A **test case kills a mutant** if it causes the mutant program to **produce different output** from the original program.\n\n\ud83d\udccd **Page 201\u2013202, Definition 5.2**:  \n> A mutant is **killed** if it fails at least one test in the test suite.\n\n- **Survived mutant** = not detected by the test set \u2192 indicates **insufficient test cases**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc 4. Mutation Score\n\n\ud83d\udccd **Page 202, Definition 5.3**\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mutation Score} = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutants killed}}{\\text{Total number of non-equivalent mutants}}\n\\]\n\n| Score | Meaning |\n|-------|---------|\n| 1.0 or 100% | Excellent tests (all faults detected) |\n| < 1.0 | More/better tests needed |\n\n\u2757 **Equivalent mutants** are syntactically different but semantically the same \u2014 cannot be killed by any test.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Example (from textbook):\n\n**Original**:\n```java\nif (a > b)\n    max = a;\nelse\n    max = b;\n```\n\n**Mutant** (relational operator replaced):\n```java\nif (a >= b)\n    max = a;\nelse\n    max = b;\n```\n\nTest input: `a = 5, b = 5`  \n- Original: `max = b`  \n- Mutant: `max = a`  \n\u2192 Output differs \u2192 Mutant killed\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 Tools for Mutation Testing\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd38 JUnit\n\n\ud83d\udccd JUnit is a **Java framework** for writing and running **unit test cases**.\n\n- Supports **assertions** to verify expected output.\n- Integration with tools like **MuClipse** enables mutation testing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd38 MuClipse (Mutation Plugin for Eclipse)\n\n- Plugin for Eclipse that:\n  - Creates mutants automatically.\n  - Runs JUnit tests.\n  - Calculates mutation score.\n- Helps visualize **which mutants survived/killed**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Case Study: Mutation Testing with JUnit and MuClipse\n\n> Use a simple Java function (e.g., `int add(int a, int b)`)  \n- Write JUnit tests for it.\n- Use MuClipse to create mutants (e.g., change `+` to `-`).\n- Run the JUnit test set.\n- Analyze which mutants were **killed** or **survived**.\n- Compute **mutation score**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf93 CST458 Exam Tips\n\n- **Part A**:\n  - \u201cWhat is a mutant?\u201d  \n  - \u201cDefine mutation score.\u201d  \n- **Part B** (14 marks):\n  - \"Explain mutation testing. Define mutants, mutation score. Give example.\"\n  - Bonus marks if you mention tools (JUnit, MuClipse) and draw the test-mutant-kill relationship.\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f **Diagram Suggestion**:\n\n```\n        [Original Program]\n              \u2193\n     Apply Mutation Operators\n              \u2193\n           [Mutants]\n              \u2193\n        Run with Test Set\n       \u2199           \u2198\n [Killed]      [Survived]\n         \u2192 Compute Mutation Score\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd16 Page Reference Summary\n\n| Concept                  | Page |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Mutants (Def 5.1)        | Page 200 |\n| Killing Mutants (Def 5.2)| Page 201 |\n| Mutation Score (Def 5.3) | Page 202 |\n| Mutation Operators       | Page 201\u2013203 (Table 5.1) |\n| JUnit & Tools (implied usage) | Practical tool, refer to case study/project guides |\n\n---\n\nWould you like to now proceed to the **final topic of Module 2: JUnit framework in detail**?"

                            "Excellent! Let's wrap up **Module 2** with:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Topic 5: **JUnit \u2013 Framework for Unit Testing**\n\n---\n\nJUnit is a widely-used **unit testing framework** for Java that supports test automation. It's especially relevant in **mutation testing**, regression testing, and **test-driven development (TDD)**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd8 While not detailed in Ammann & Offutt\u2019s textbook, JUnit is used in practice to implement many of the textbook\u2019s **unit testing concepts**, particularly with **MuClipse** for mutation testing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 What is JUnit?\n\n> JUnit is an open-source **Java framework** that allows developers to write and execute **repeatable unit tests**.\n\nIt is based on **annotations** and uses **assertions** to verify expected outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Basic JUnit Annotations\n\n| Annotation | Purpose |\n|------------|---------|\n| `@Test` | Marks a method as a test case |\n| `@BeforeEach` | Code that runs **before** each test method |\n| `@AfterEach` | Code that runs **after** each test method |\n| `@BeforeAll` | Code that runs **once before all** tests |\n| `@AfterAll` | Code that runs **once after all** tests |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Example: JUnit Test Case\n\n#### Source Code:\n```java\npublic class Calculator {\n    public int add(int a, int b) {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Test Class:\n```java\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n\npublic class CalculatorTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testAdd() {\n        Calculator calc = new Calculator();\n        assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));\n        assertEquals(0, calc.add(-2, 2));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Key Features of JUnit\n\n- **Fast execution** of multiple test cases.\n- **Automated**: run tests automatically via IDEs or build tools (like Maven).\n- **Independent** test cases.\n- Supports **test suites** and **assertions**.\n- Integrates well with tools like:\n  - **MuClipse** for mutation testing\n  - **JaCoCo** for code coverage\n  - **CI/CD pipelines** (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Common JUnit Assertions\n\n| Assertion | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| `assertEquals(expected, actual)` | Checks if result matches |\n| `assertTrue(condition)` | Checks if condition is true |\n| `assertFalse(condition)` | Checks if condition is false |\n| `assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> { ... })` | Check if code throws expected exception |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea JUnit + Mutation Testing Case Study (with MuClipse)\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 Though not in the textbook, this is a **recommended lab/project topic** for CST458:\n\n1. **Write a function in Java**\n2. **Create JUnit test cases**\n3. **Use MuClipse** in Eclipse to:\n   - Generate mutants\n   - Run tests\n   - Identify which mutants were **killed** or **survived**\n4. **Calculate Mutation Score**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Diagram (for exams):\n\n```\n    [Java Code]\n         \u2193\n    [JUnit Tests]\n         \u2193\n   Execute via IDE / CLI\n         \u2193\n  \u2714 Tests Pass or \u274c Fail\n         \u2193\n  [Optional: MuClipse] \u2192 Mutation Score\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf93 CST458 Exam Tips\n\n- **Part A**:\n  - \u201cWhat is JUnit?\u201d  \n  - \u201cList any two JUnit annotations.\u201d\n- **Part B**:\n  - \u201cExplain JUnit framework. How is it used for unit testing in Java? Illustrate with an example.\u201d\n  - \u201cHow is JUnit used with mutation testing in MuClipse?\u201d\n\nInclude:\n- Sample code\n- Table of annotations\n- Tools used (JUnit + MuClipse)\n- Mention automation and regression support\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd16 Page Reference Summary\n\n| Concept               | Location     |\n|-----------------------|--------------|\n| JUnit framework       | Not in textbook \u2013 Use lecture/lab materials |\n| Mutation case study   | Related to Chapter 5 concepts (Page 199\u2013222) |\n| MuClipse integration  | Mentioned in course/project guides |\n\n---\n\n\u2705 That concludes **Module 2: Unit Testing**.\n\nWould you like a **recap summary** of the entire module before moving to **Module 3: White-Box Testing**?"

The if-else structure results in two basic blocks.\n\nNote that the two statements in the then part of the if statement both appear\nin the same node. Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node.

Node n1 is some-\ntimes called a \u201cdummy node,\u201d because it does not represent any statements, but\ngives the iteration edge (n2, n1) somewhere to go. Node n1 can also be thought of as\nrepresenting a decision. A common mistake for beginners is to try to have the edge\ngo to n0; this is not correct because that would mean the initialization step is done\neach iteration of the loop. Note that the method call f(x,y) is not expanded in this\nparticular graph; we return to this issue later.\n\nNow, consider a for loop that is equivalent to the prior while loop. The graph\nbecomes a little more complicated, as shown in Figure 2.19, essentially because the\nfor structure is at a very high level of abstraction.\n\nAlthough the initialization, test, and increment of the loop control variable x are\nall on the same line in the program, they need to be associated with different nodes\nin the graph. The control flow graph for the for loop is slightly different from that\nof the while loop. Specifically, we show the increment of x in a different node than\nthe method call y = f(x,y). Technically speaking, this violates the definition of a ba-\nsic block and the two nodes should be combined, but it is often easier to develop\ntemplates for the various possible program structures and then plug the control\nflow graph for the relevant code into the correct spot in the template. Commer-\ncial tools typically do this to make the graph generation simpler. In fact, commercial\ntools often do not follow the strict definition of the basic block and sometimes add\nseemingly random nodes. This can have trivial effects on the bookkeeping (for ex-\n# \u30101\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFull inter-procedural data flow identifies all du-pairs between a caller (A()) and\na callee (B()).

For the variable\nreference to be the same, both A() and B() must be called through the same instance\ncontext, or object reference. That is, if the calls are o.A() and o.B(), they are called\nthrough the instance context of o. If the calls are not made through the same instance\ncontext, the definition and use will be to different instances of the variable.\n\nThe right side of Figure 2.30 illustrates \u201cindirect\u201d du-pairs. In this scenario, the\ncoupling method F() calls two methods, M() and N(), which in turn call two other\nmethods, A() and B(). The def and use are in A() and B(), so the reference is indirect.\nThe analysis for indirect du-pairs is considerably more complicated than for direct\ndu-pairs. It should be obvious that there can be more than one call between the\ncoupling method and the methods with the def and use.\n\nIn OO data flow testing, the methods A() and B() could be in the same class, or\nthey could be in different classes and accessing the same global variables.\n\nFinally, Figure 2.31 illustrates du-pairs in distributed software. P1 and P2 are two\nprocesses, threads, or other distributed software components, and they call A() and\nB(), which def and use the same variable. The distribution and communication could\nuse any of a number of methods, including HTTP (Web-based), remote method\ninvocation (RMI), or CORBA. A() and B() could be in the same class or could access\na persistent variable such as a Web session variable or permanent data store. While\nthis sort of \u201cvery loosely coupled\u201d software can be expected to have far fewer du-\npairs, identifying them, finding def-clear paths between them, and designing test\ncases to cover them is quite complicated.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.4.\n# \u30102\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFigure 2.16.

As in Section 2.2, we first\nconsider structural coverage criteria and then data flow criteria.\n\n2.3.1 Structural Graph Coverage for Source Code\n\nThe most widely used graph coverage criteria are defined on source code. Although\nprecise details vary from one programming language to another, the basic pattern is\nthe same for most common languages. To apply one of the graph criteria, the first\nstep is to define the graph, and for source code, the most common graph is called a\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Control flow graphs associate an edge with each possible\nbranch in the program, and a node with sequences of statements. Formally, a basic\nblock is a maximum sequence of program statements such that if any one statement\nof the block is executed, all statements in the block are executed. A basic block has\nonly one entry point and one exit point. Our first example language structure is an\nif statement with an else clause, shown as Java code followed by the corresponding\nCFG in Figure 2.16. The if-else structure results in two basic blocks.\n\nNote that the two statements in the then part of the if statement both appear\nin the same node. Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node. Node n3, which has more than one\nin-edge, is called a junction node.\n\nNext we turn to the degenerate case of an if statement without an else clause,\nshown in Figure 2.17. This is the same graph previously seen in Figure 2.6, but this\ntime based on actual program statements.\n\nNote that the control flow graph for this structure has only three nodes. The\nreader should note that a test with x < y traverses all of the nodes in this control\nflow graph, but not all of the edges.\n\nRepresenting loops is a little tricky because we have to include nodes that are\nnot directly derived from program statements. The simplest kind of loop is a while\nloop with an initializing statement, as shown in Figure 2.18.

The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n\nForman also suggested a way to detect data flow anomalies without running the\nprogram [121].\n\nSome detailed problems with data flow testing have been recurring. These in-\nclude the application of data flow when paths between definitions and uses cannot\nbe executed [127], and handling pointers and arrays [267, 345].\n\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n# \u30106\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nHowever, the development above does not work if the graph\nhas definitions on edges. The problem is that a du-path from an edge to an edge is\nno longer necessarily simple, since instead of simply having a common first and last\nnode, such a du-path now might have a common first and last edge. It is possible\nto modify the definitions to explicitly mention definitions and uses on edges as well\nas nodes, but the definitions tend to get messier. The bibliographic notes contain\npointers for this type of development.\n\nFigure 2.14 illustrates the differences among the three data flow coverage cri-\nteria with the double-diamond graph. The graph has one def, so only one path is\nneeded to satisfy all-defs. The def has two uses, so two paths are needed to satisfy\nall-uses. Since two paths go from the def to each use, four paths are needed to sat-\nisfy all-du-paths. Note that the definitions of the data flow criteria leave open the\nchoice of touring. The literature uses various choices \u2013 in some cases demanding\ndirect touring, and, in other cases, allowing def-clear sidetrips. Our recommenda-\ntion is best-effort touring, a choice that, in contrast to the treatments in the litera-\nture, yields the desired subsumption relationships even in the case of infeasible test\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n50 Coverage Criteria\n\nrequirements. From a practical perspective, best-effort touring also makes sense \u2013\neach test requirement is satisfied as rigorously as possible.\n\n2.2.3 Subsumption Relationships among Graph Coverage Criteria\n\nRecall from Chapter 1 that coverage criteria are often related to one another by sub-\nsumption. The first relation to note is that edge coverage subsumes node coverage.\nIn most cases, this is because if we traverse every edge in a graph, we will visit every\nnode. However, if a graph has a node with no incoming or outgoing edges, travers-\ning every edge will not reach that node. Thus, edge coverage is defined to include\nevery path of length up to 1, that is, of length 0 (all nodes) and length 1 (all edges).\nThe subsumption does not hold in the reverse direction. Recall that Figure 2.6 gave\nan example test set that satisfied node coverage but not edge coverage. Hence, node\ncoverage does not subsume edge coverage.\n\nWe have a variety of subsumption relations among the criteria. Where applica-\nble, the structural coverage relations assume best-effort touring. Because best-effort\nTouring is assumed, the subsumption results hold even if some test requirements are\ninfeasible.\n\nThe subsumption results for data flow criteria are based on three assumptions:\n(1) every use is preceded by a def, (2) every def reaches at least one use, and (3)\nfor every node with multiple outgoing edges, at least one variable is used on each\nout edge, and the same variables are used on each out edge.

This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n\nThe notion of subpath sets was developed by Offutt et al. [178, 265] to sup-\nport inter-class path testing and is essentially equivalent to tours with detours as\npresented here. The ideas of touring, sidetrips and detours were introduced by\nAmmann, Offutt and Huang [17].\n\nThe earliest reference we have found on data flow testing was a technical report\nin 1974 by Osterweil and Fosdick [282]. This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n# \u30108\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[347] Lee White, Husain Almezen, and Nasser Alzeidi.

Specifically, the \u201cat least one du-path\u201d\ndirective in All-Uses is changed to \u201cevery path\u201d in All-du-Paths. Thought of in terms\nof def-use pairs, All-Uses requires some def-clear simple path to each use, whereas\nAll-du-Paths requires all def-clear simple paths to each use.\n\nTo simplify the development above, we assumed that definitions and uses oc-\ncurred on nodes. Naturally, definitions and uses can occur on edges as well. It turns\nout that the development above also works for uses on edges, so data flow on pro-\ngram flow graphs can be easily defined (uses on program flow graph edges are some-\ntimes called \u201cp-uses\u201d). However, the development above does not work if the graph\nhas definitions on edges. The problem is that a du-path from an edge to an edge is\nno longer necessarily simple, since instead of simply having a common first and last\nnode, such a du-path now might have a common first and last edge.

Node n1 is some-\ntimes called a \u201cdummy node,\u201d because it does not represent any statements, but\ngives the iteration edge (n2, n1) somewhere to go. Node n1 can also be thought of as\nrepresenting a decision. A common mistake for beginners is to try to have the edge\ngo to n0; this is not correct because that would mean the initialization step is done\neach iteration of the loop. Note that the method call f(x,y) is not expanded in this\nparticular graph; we return to this issue later.\n\nNow, consider a for loop that is equivalent to the prior while loop. The graph\nbecomes a little more complicated, as shown in Figure 2.19, essentially because the\nfor structure is at a very high level of abstraction.\n\nAlthough the initialization, test, and increment of the loop control variable x are\nall on the same line in the program, they need to be associated with different nodes\nin the graph. The control flow graph for the for loop is slightly different from that\nof the while loop. Specifically, we show the increment of x in a different node than\nthe method call y = f(x,y). Technically speaking, this violates the definition of a ba-\nsic block and the two nodes should be combined, but it is often easier to develop\ntemplates for the various possible program structures and then plug the control\nflow graph for the relevant code into the correct spot in the template. Commer-\ncial tools typically do this to make the graph generation simpler. In fact, commercial\ntools often do not follow the strict definition of the basic block and sometimes add\nseemingly random nodes. This can have trivial effects on the bookkeeping (for ex-\n\nx = 0;\nwhile (x < y)\n{\n   y = f (x, y);\n   x = x+1;\n}\n\nn1\n\nn3n2\n\nn0\n\nx > y\n\nx = 0\n\nx < y\n\ny = f (x, y)\nx = x + 1\n\nFigure 2.18.

The case\nstructure can be graphed either as a single node with multi-way branching or as a\nseries of if-then-else structures. We choose to illustrate the case structure with multi-\nway branching, as in Figure 2.20.\n\nThe coverage criteria from the previous section can now be applied to graphs\nfrom source code. The application is direct with only the names being changed.\nNode coverage is often called statement coverage or basic block coverage, and edge\ncoverage is often called branch coverage.\n\n2.3.2 Data Flow Graph Coverage for Source Code\n# \u301011\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe right side of Figure 2.30 illustrates \u201cindirect\u201d du-pairs. In this scenario, the\ncoupling method F() calls two methods, M() and N(), which in turn call two other\nmethods, A() and B(). The def and use are in A() and B(), so the reference is indirect.\nThe analysis for indirect du-pairs is considerably more complicated than for direct\ndu-pairs. It should be obvious that there can be more than one call between the\ncoupling method and the methods with the def and use.\n\nIn OO data flow testing, the methods A() and B() could be in the same class, or\nthey could be in different classes and accessing the same global variables.\n\nFinally, Figure 2.31 illustrates du-pairs in distributed software. P1 and P2 are two\nprocesses, threads, or other distributed software components, and they call A() and\nB(), which def and use the same variable. The distribution and communication could\nuse any of a number of methods, including HTTP (Web-based), remote method\ninvocation (RMI), or CORBA. A() and B() could be in the same class or could access\na persistent variable such as a Web session variable or permanent data store. While\nthis sort of \u201cvery loosely coupled\u201d software can be expected to have far fewer du-\npairs, identifying them, finding def-clear paths between them, and designing test\ncases to cover them is quite complicated.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.4.\n\n1.

This notion\nis refined to a coupling du-path with respect to a coupling variable x. A coupling\ndu-path is a path from a last-def to a first-use.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.2 can now be applied to coupling graphs.\nAll-Defs coverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to at least\none first-use. In this context, all-defs is called All-Coupling-Def coverage. All-Uses\ncoverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to every first-use. In\nthis context, All-Uses is also called All-Coupling-Use coverage.\n\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used.

How else could we compare test criteria besides subsumption?\n\n1.4 OLDER SOFTWARE TESTING TERMINOLOGY\n\nThe testing research community has been very active in the past two decades, and\nsome of our fundamental views of what and how to test have changed. This section\npresents some of the terminology that has been in use for many years, but for various\nreasons has become dated. Despite the fact that they are not as relevant now as they\nwere at one time, these terms are still used and it is important that testing students\nand professionals be familiar with them.\n\nFrom an abstract perspective, black-box and white-box testing are very similar.\nIn this book in particular, we present testing as proceeding from abstract models of\nthe software such as graphs, which can as easily be derived from a black-box view or\na white-box view. Thus, one of the most obvious effects of the unique philosophical\nstructure of this book is that these two terms become obsolete.\n\nDefinition 1.25 Black-box testing: Deriving tests from external descriptions\nof the software, including specifications, requirements, and design.\n\nDefinition 1.26 White-box testing: Deriving tests from the source code inter-\nnals of the software, specifically including branches, individual conditions,\nand statements.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a discussion took place over whether testing should proceed\nfrom the top down or from the bottom up. This was an echo of a previous discussion\nover how to develop software. This distinction has pretty much disappeared as we\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n22 Overview\n\nfirst learned that top-down testing is impractical, then OO design pretty much made\nthe distinction obsolete. The following pair of definitions assumes that software can\nbe viewed as a tree of software procedures, where the edges represent calls and the\nroot of the tree is the main procedure.\n\nDefinition 1.27 Top-Down Testing: Test the main procedure, then go down\nthrough procedures it calls, and so on.\n\nDefinition 1.28 Bottom-Up Testing: Test the leaves in the tree (procedures\nthat make no calls), and move up to the root. Each procedure is tested only\nif all of its children have been tested.\n\nOO software leads to a more general problem. The relationships among classes\ncan be formulated as general graphs with cycles, requiring test engineers to make\nthe difficult choice of what order to test the classes in. This problem is discussed in\nChapter 6.\n\nSome parts of the literature separate static and dynamic testing as follows:\n\nDefinition 1.29 Static Testing: Testing without executing the program. This\nincludes software inspections and some forms of analysis.\n\nDefinition 1.30 Dynamic Testing: Testing by executing the program with real\ninputs.\n\nMost of the literature currently uses \u201ctesting\u201d to refer to dynamic testing and\n\u201cstatic testing\u201d is called \u201cverification activities.\u201d We follow that use in this book and\nit should be pointed out that this book is only concerned with dynamic or execution-\nbased testing.\n\nOne last term bears mentioning because of the lack of definition. Test Strategy\nhas been used to mean a variety of things, including coverage criterion, test process,\nand technologies used. We will avoid using it.\n\n1.5 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAll books on software testing and all researchers owe major thanks to the landmark\nbooks in 1979 by Myers [249], in 1990 by Beizer [29], and in 2000 by Binder [33].\nSome excellent overviews of unit testing criteria have also been published, including\none by White [349] and more recently by Zhu, Hall, and May [367].\n# \u301014\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n\nCoupling was first discussed as a design metric by Constantine and Yourdon [88],\nand its use for testing was introduced implicitly by Harrold, Soffa, and Rothermel\n[152, 154] and explicitly by Jin and Offutt [178], who introduced the use of first-uses\nand last-defs.\n\nKim, Hong, Cho, Bae, and Cha used a graph-based approach to generate tests\nfrom UML state diagrams [186].\n\nThe USA\u2019s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has recognized the increased\nimportance of modularity and integration testing by imposing requirements on\nstructural coverage analysis of software that \u201cthe analysis should confirm the data\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 103\n\ncoupling and control coupling between the code components\u201d [305], p. 33, section\n6.4.4.2.\n\nData flow testing has also been applied to integration testing by Harrold and\nSoffa [154], Harrold and Rothermel [152], and Jin and Offutt [178]. This work\nfocused on class-level integration issues, but did not address inheritance or poly-\nmorphism. Data flow testing has been applied to inheritance and polymorphism in\nobject-oriented software by Alexander and Offutt [11, 10, 12], and Buy, Orso, and\nPezze [60, 281]. Gallagher and Offutt modeled classes as interacting state machines,\nand tested concurrency and communication issues among them [132].\n\nSCR was first discussed by Henninger [157], and its use in model checking and\ntesting was introduced by Atlee [20].\n\nConstructing tests from UML diagrams is a more recent development, though\nrelatively straightforward. It was first suggested by Abdurazik and Offutt [2, 264],\nand soon followed by Briand and Labiche [45].\n# \u301015\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAn extension of this is the all object call criterion, which requires that call cover-\nage be satisfied for every object that is instantiated for every class.\n\n2.4.2 Data Flow Graph Coverage for Design Elements\n\nControl connections among design elements are simple and straightforward and\ntests based on them are probably not very effective at finding faults. On the other\nhand, data flow connections are often very complex and difficult to analyze. For\na tester, that should immediately suggest that they are a rich source for software\nfaults. The primary issue is where the defs and uses occur. When testing program\nunits, the defs and uses are in the same unit. During integration testing, defs and\nuses are in different units. This section starts with some standard compiler/program\nanalysis terms.\n\nA caller is a unit that invokes another unit, the callee. The statement that makes\nthe call is the call site. An actual parameter is in the caller; its value is assigned to\na formal parameter in the callee. The interface between two units is the mapping of\nactual to formal parameters.\n\nThe underlying premise of the data flow testing criteria for design elements is\nthat to achieve confidence in the interfaces between integrated program units, it\nmust be ensured that variables defined in caller units be appropriately used in callee\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n68 Coverage Criteria\n\nA\n\nend B\n\nB (Y)\n\nend A\n\nB (X)\n\nCaller\n\nCallee\n\nActual Parameters\n\nFormal Parameters\n\nInterface{ ...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nFigure 2.25. An example of parameter\ncoupling.\n\nunits. This technique can be limited to the unit interfaces, allowing us to restrict our\nattention to the last definitions of variables just before calls to and returns from the\ncalled units, and the first uses of variables just after calls to and returns from the\ncalled unit.\n\nFigure 2.25 illustrates the relationships that the data flow criteria will test. The\ncriteria require execution from definitions of actual parameters through calls to uses\nof formal parameters.\n\nThree types of data flow couplings have been identified. The most obvious is pa-\nrameter coupling, where parameters are passed in calls. Shared data coupling occurs\nwhen two units access the same data object as a global or other non-local variable,\nand external device coupling occurs when two units access the same external medium\nsuch as a file. In the following, all examples and discussion will be in terms of param-\neters and it will be understood that the concepts apply equally to shared data and\nexternal device coupling. We use the general term coupling variable for variables\nthat are defined in one unit and used in another.\n\nThis form of data flow is concerned only with last-defs before calls and returns\nand first-uses after calls and returns. That is, it is concerned only with defs and\nuses immediately surrounding the calls between methods. The last-defs before a\ncall are locations with defs that reach uses at callsites and the last-defs before a re-\nturn are locations with defs that reach a return statement. The following definitions\nassume a variable that is defined in either the caller or the callee, and used in the\nother.\n\nDefinition 2.40 Last-def: The set of nodes that define a variable x for which\nthere is a def-clear path from the node through the call site to a use in the\nother unit.\n\nThe variable can be passed as a parameter, a return value, or a shared variable\nreference. If the function has no return statement, an implicit return statement is\nassumed to exist at the last statement in the method.\n# \u301016\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used. The complete set of coupling\ndu-pairs for class Quadratic is\n\n(main(), X, 16) -- (Root(), A, 47)\n(main(), Y, 17) -- (Root(), B, 47)\n(main(), Z, 18) -- (Root(), C, 47)\n(main(), X, 23) -- (Root(), A, 47)\n(main(), Y, 24) -- (Root(), B, 47)\n(main(), Z, 25) -- (Root(), C, 47)\n(main(), X, 30) -- (Root(), A, 47)\n(main(), Y, 31) -- (Root(), B, 47)\n(main(), Z, 32) -- (Root(), C, 47)\n(Root(), Root1, 53) -- (main(), Root1, 37)\n(Root(), Root2, 54) -- (main(), Root2, 37)\n(Root(), Result, 50) -- (main(), ok, 35)\n(Root(), Result, 55) -- (main(), ok, 35)\n\nA couple of notes are important to remember about coupling data flow. First,\nonly variables that are used or defined in the callee are considered. That is, last-defs\nthat have no corresponding first-uses are not useful for testing. Second, we must\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 71\n# \u301017\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAs\nof this writing, it is still not clear how best to test these language features or what\ncriteria are appropriate. This text introduces the current state of knowledge; the\ninterested reader is encouraged to keep up with the literature for continuing results\nand techniques for testing OO software. The bibliographic notes give some current\nreferences, and further ideas are discussed in Chapter 7. The most obvious graph\nto create for testing these features (which we collectively call \u201cthe OO language\nfeatures\u201d) is the inheritance hierarchy. Figure 2.23 represents a small inheritance\nhierarchy with four classes. Classes C and D inherit from B, and B in turn inherits\nfrom A.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.1 can be applied to inheritance hierarchies\nin ways that are superficially simple, but have some subtle problems. In OO pro-\ngramming, classes are not directly tested because they are not executable. In fact, the\nedges in the inheritance hierarchy do not represent execution flow at all, but rather\ninheritance dependencies. To apply any type of coverage, we first need a model for\n\nA\n\nDC\n\nB\n\nFigure 2.23.

An inher-\nitance hierarchy with\nobjects instantiated.\n\nwhat coverage means. The first step is to require that objects be instantiated for\nsome or all of the classes. Figure 2.24 shows the inheritance hierarchy from Figure\n2.23 with one object instantiated for each class.\n\nThe most obvious interpretation of node coverage for this graph is to require\nthat at least one object be created for each class. However, this seems weak because\nit says nothing about execution. The logical extension is to require that for each\nobject of each class, the call graph must be covered according to the call coverage\ncriterion above. Thus, the OO call coverage criterion can be called an \u201caggregation\ncriterion\u201d because it requires call coverage to be applied on at least one object for\neach class.\n\nAn extension of this is the all object call criterion, which requires that call cover-\nage be satisfied for every object that is instantiated for every class.\n\n2.4.2 Data Flow Graph Coverage for Design Elements\n\nControl connections among design elements are simple and straightforward and\ntests based on them are probably not very effective at finding faults. On the other\nhand, data flow connections are often very complex and difficult to analyze. For\na tester, that should immediately suggest that they are a rich source for software\nfaults.

As in Section 2.2, we first\nconsider structural coverage criteria and then data flow criteria.\n\n2.3.1 Structural Graph Coverage for Source Code\n\nThe most widely used graph coverage criteria are defined on source code. Although\nprecise details vary from one programming language to another, the basic pattern is\nthe same for most common languages. To apply one of the graph criteria, the first\nstep is to define the graph, and for source code, the most common graph is called a\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Control flow graphs associate an edge with each possible\nbranch in the program, and a node with sequences of statements. Formally, a basic\nblock is a maximum sequence of program statements such that if any one statement\nof the block is executed, all statements in the block are executed. A basic block has\nonly one entry point and one exit point. Our first example language structure is an\nif statement with an else clause, shown as Java code followed by the corresponding\nCFG in Figure 2.16. The if-else structure results in two basic blocks.\n\nNote that the two statements in the then part of the if statement both appear\nin the same node. Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node. Node n3, which has more than one\nin-edge, is called a junction node.\n# \u301019\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFigure 7.11. Def-use pairs in object-oriented software.\n\nthat are indirectly defined within m() and i-uses(m) is the set of variables used by\nm().\n\nA coupling sequence is a pair of nodes that call two methods in sequence; the first\nmethod defines a variable and the second uses it. Both calls must be made through\nthe same instance object. The calling method is called the coupling method f(), and\nit calls m(), the antecedent method, to define x, and n(), the consequent method, to\nuse x. This is illustrated in Figure 7.11 (repeated from Chapter 2). If the antecedent\nor consequent method is the same as the coupling method, that is a special case that\nis handled implicitly. If the antecedent or consequent method is called from another\nmethod that is called by f(), this an indirect data flow (right side of Figure 7.11),\nwhich we do not discuss.\n\nThe control flow schematic shown in Figure 7.12 illustrates the coupling method\ncalling both the antecedent and consequent methods. The schematic abstracts away\nthe details of the control flow graph and shows only nodes that are relevant to cou-\npling analysis. The thin line segments represent control flow and the thicker lines\nindicate control flow that is part of a coupling path. The line segments can represent\nmultiple sub-paths. A path may be annotated with a transmission set such as [o, o.v],\nwhich contains variables for which the path is definition-clear.\n\nAssuming that the intervening sub-paths are def-clear with respect to the state\nvariable o.v, the path in Figure 7.12 from h to i to j to k and finally l forms a trans-\nmission path with respect to o.v. The object o is called the context variable.\n\nEvery coupling sequence s j,k has some state variables that are defined by the\nantecedent method and then used by the consequent method. This set of variables\nis the coupling set \ufffdt\n\ns j,k\nof s j,k and is defined as the intersection of those variables\n\ndefined by m() (an indirect-def or i-def) and used by n() (an indirect use or i-use)\nthrough the instance context provided by a context variable o that is bound to an\ninstance of t. Which versions of m() and n() execute is determined by the actual type\nt of the instance bound to o. The members of the coupling set are called coupling\nvariables.\n\nCoupling sequences require that there be at least one def-clear path between\neach node in the sequence. Identifying these paths as parts of complete sequences of\nnodes results in the set of coupling paths. A coupling path is considered to transmit\na def of a variable to a use.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 251\n\nCoupling\nMethod\n\ni o.m()\n\nk o.n()\n\nj def(o.v)\n\nh def(o)\n\nm()\n\nf()\n\nn()\n\nl use(o.v)\n\nCoupling\nSequence\n\n sj,k\n\nwith\nrespect\nto o.v\n\ntransmission \npath[o, o.v ]\n\n[o]\n\ni-def path\n[o.v ]\n\ni-use path\n[o.v ]\n\nAntecedent\nNode\n\nConsequent\nNode\n\nCoupling Context\n\nCall site\nCall return\nMethod entry\n\nStatement\nControl Flow\nCoupling Path\n\nMethod exit\n\nTransmission set[...]\n\nAntecedent\nMethod\n\nConsequent\nMethod\n\nFigure 7.12.

Note that the method call f(x,y) is not expanded in this\nparticular graph; we return to this issue later.\n\nNow, consider a for loop that is equivalent to the prior while loop. The graph\nbecomes a little more complicated, as shown in Figure 2.19, essentially because the\nfor structure is at a very high level of abstraction.\n\nAlthough the initialization, test, and increment of the loop control variable x are\nall on the same line in the program, they need to be associated with different nodes\nin the graph. The control flow graph for the for loop is slightly different from that\nof the while loop. Specifically, we show the increment of x in a different node than\nthe method call y = f(x,y). Technically speaking, this violates the definition of a ba-\nsic block and the two nodes should be combined, but it is often easier to develop\ntemplates for the various possible program structures and then plug the control\nflow graph for the relevant code into the correct spot in the template. Commer-\ncial tools typically do this to make the graph generation simpler. In fact, commercial\ntools often do not follow the strict definition of the basic block and sometimes add\nseemingly random nodes. This can have trivial effects on the bookkeeping (for ex-\n",

As in Section 2.2, we first\nconsider structural coverage criteria and then data flow criteria.\n\n2.3.1 Structural Graph Coverage for Source Code\n\nThe most widely used graph coverage criteria are defined on source code. Although\nprecise details vary from one programming language to another, the basic pattern is\nthe same for most common languages. To apply one of the graph criteria, the first\nstep is to define the graph, and for source code, the most common graph is called a\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Control flow graphs associate an edge with each possible\nbranch in the program, and a node with sequences of statements. Formally, a basic\nblock is a maximum sequence of program statements such that if any one statement\nof the block is executed, all statements in the block are executed. A basic block has\nonly one entry point and one exit point. Our first example language structure is an\nif statement with an else clause, shown as Java code followed by the corresponding\nCFG in Figure 2.16. The if-else structure results in two basic blocks.\n\nNote that the two statements in the then part of the if statement both appear\nin the same node. Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node. Node n3, which has more than one\nin-edge, is called a junction node.\n\nNext we turn to the degenerate case of an if statement without an else clause,\nshown in Figure 2.17. This is the same graph previously seen in Figure 2.6, but this\ntime based on actual program statements.\n\nNote that the control flow graph for this structure has only three nodes. The\nreader should note that a test with x < y traverses all of the nodes in this control\nflow graph, but not all of the edges.\n\nRepresenting loops is a little tricky because we have to include nodes that are\nnot directly derived from program statements. The simplest kind of loop is a while\nloop with an initializing statement, as shown in Figure 2.18.

The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n\nForman also suggested a way to detect data flow anomalies without running the\nprogram [121].\n\nSome detailed problems with data flow testing have been recurring. These in-\nclude the application of data flow when paths between definitions and uses cannot\nbe executed [127], and handling pointers and arrays [267, 345].\n\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n",

The problem is that a du-path from an edge to an edge is\nno longer necessarily simple, since instead of simply having a common first and last\nnode, such a du-path now might have a common first and last edge. It is possible\nto modify the definitions to explicitly mention definitions and uses on edges as well\nas nodes, but the definitions tend to get messier. The bibliographic notes contain\npointers for this type of development.\n\nFigure 2.14 illustrates the differences among the three data flow coverage cri-\nteria with the double-diamond graph.

The first relation to note is that edge coverage subsumes node coverage.\nIn most cases, this is because if we traverse every edge in a graph, we will visit every\nnode. However, if a graph has a node with no incoming or outgoing edges, travers-\ning every edge will not reach that node. Thus, edge coverage is defined to include\nevery path of length up to 1, that is, of length 0 (all nodes) and length 1 (all edges).\nThe subsumption does not hold in the reverse direction. Recall that Figure 2.6 gave\nan example test set that satisfied node coverage but not edge coverage. Hence, node\ncoverage does not subsume edge coverage.\n\nWe have a variety of subsumption relations among the criteria. Where applica-\nble, the structural coverage relations assume best-effort touring. Because best-effort\nTouring is assumed, the subsumption results hold even if some test requirements are\ninfeasible.\n\nThe subsumption results for data flow criteria are based on three assumptions:\n(1) every use is preceded by a def, (2) every def reaches at least one use, and (3)\nfor every node with multiple outgoing edges, at least one variable is used on each\nout edge, and the same variables are used on each out edge.

This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n\nThe notion of subpath sets was developed by Offutt et al. [178, 265] to sup-\nport inter-class path testing and is essentially equivalent to tours with detours as\npresented here. The ideas of touring, sidetrips and detours were introduced by\nAmmann, Offutt and Huang [17].\n\nThe earliest reference we have found on data flow testing was a technical report\nin 1974 by Osterweil and Fosdick [282]. This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n",

Specifically, the \u201cat least one du-path\u201d\ndirective in All-Uses is changed to \u201cevery path\u201d in All-du-Paths. Thought of in terms\nof def-use pairs, All-Uses requires some def-clear simple path to each use, whereas\nAll-du-Paths requires all def-clear simple paths to each use.\n\nTo simplify the development above, we assumed that definitions and uses oc-\ncurred on nodes. Naturally, definitions and uses can occur on edges as well. It turns\nout that the development above also works for uses on edges, so data flow on pro-\ngram flow graphs can be easily defined (uses on program flow graph edges are some-\ntimes called \u201cp-uses\u201d). However, the development above does not work if the graph\nhas definitions on edges. The problem is that a du-path from an edge to an edge is\nno longer necessarily simple, since instead of simply having a common first and last\nnode, such a du-path now might have a common first and last edge. It is possible\nto modify the definitions to explicitly mention definitions and uses on edges as well\nas nodes, but the definitions tend to get messier. The bibliographic notes contain\npointers for this type of development.\n\nFigure 2.14 illustrates the differences among the three data flow coverage cri-\nteria with the double-diamond graph. The graph has one def, so only one path is\nneeded to satisfy all-defs. The def has two uses, so two paths are needed to satisfy\nall-uses. Since two paths go from the def to each use, four paths are needed to sat-\nisfy all-du-paths. Note that the definitions of the data flow criteria leave open the\nchoice of touring. The literature uses various choices \u2013 in some cases demanding\ndirect touring, and, in other cases, allowing def-clear sidetrips. Our recommenda-\ntion is best-effort touring, a choice that, in contrast to the treatments in the litera-\nture, yields the desired subsumption relationships even in the case of infeasible test\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n50 Coverage Criteria\n\nrequirements.

Node n1 can also be thought of as\nrepresenting a decision. A common mistake for beginners is to try to have the edge\ngo to n0; this is not correct because that would mean the initialization step is done\neach iteration of the loop. Note that the method call f(x,y) is not expanded in this\nparticular graph; we return to this issue later.\n\nNow, consider a for loop that is equivalent to the prior while loop. The graph\nbecomes a little more complicated, as shown in Figure 2.19, essentially because the\nfor structure is at a very high level of abstraction.\n\nAlthough the initialization, test, and increment of the loop control variable x are\nall on the same line in the program, they need to be associated with different nodes\nin the graph. The control flow graph for the for loop is slightly different from that\nof the while loop. Specifically, we show the increment of x in a different node than\nthe method call y = f(x,y). Technically speaking, this violates the definition of a ba-\nsic block and the two nodes should be combined, but it is often easier to develop\ntemplates for the various possible program structures and then plug the control\nflow graph for the relevant code into the correct spot in the template. Commer-\ncial tools typically do this to make the graph generation simpler. In fact, commercial\ntools often do not follow the strict definition of the basic block and sometimes add\nseemingly random nodes.

This notion\nis refined to a coupling du-path with respect to a coupling variable x. A coupling\ndu-path is a path from a last-def to a first-use.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.2 can now be applied to coupling graphs.\nAll-Defs coverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to at least\none first-use. In this context, all-defs is called All-Coupling-Def coverage. All-Uses\ncoverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to every first-use. In\nthis context, All-Uses is also called All-Coupling-Use coverage.\n\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used.

This section\npresents some of the terminology that has been in use for many years, but for various\nreasons has become dated. Despite the fact that they are not as relevant now as they\nwere at one time, these terms are still used and it is important that testing students\nand professionals be familiar with them.\n\nFrom an abstract perspective, black-box and white-box testing are very similar.\nIn this book in particular, we present testing as proceeding from abstract models of\nthe software such as graphs, which can as easily be derived from a black-box view or\na white-box view. Thus, one of the most obvious effects of the unique philosophical\nstructure of this book is that these two terms become obsolete.\n\nDefinition 1.25 Black-box testing: Deriving tests from external descriptions\nof the software, including specifications, requirements, and design.\n\nDefinition 1.26 White-box testing: Deriving tests from the source code inter-\nnals of the software, specifically including branches, individual conditions,\nand statements.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a discussion took place over whether testing should proceed\nfrom the top down or from the bottom up.

The following pair of definitions assumes that software can\nbe viewed as a tree of software procedures, where the edges represent calls and the\nroot of the tree is the main procedure.\n\nDefinition 1.27 Top-Down Testing: Test the main procedure, then go down\nthrough procedures it calls, and so on.\n\nDefinition 1.28 Bottom-Up Testing: Test the leaves in the tree (procedures\nthat make no calls), and move up to the root. Each procedure is tested only\nif all of its children have been tested.\n\nOO software leads to a more general problem. The relationships among classes\ncan be formulated as general graphs with cycles, requiring test engineers to make\nthe difficult choice of what order to test the classes in. This problem is discussed in\nChapter 6.\n\nSome parts of the literature separate static and dynamic testing as follows:\n\nDefinition 1.29 Static Testing: Testing without executing the program. This\nincludes software inspections and some forms of analysis.\n\nDefinition 1.30 Dynamic Testing: Testing by executing the program with real\ninputs.\n\nMost of the literature currently uses \u201ctesting\u201d to refer to dynamic testing and\n\u201cstatic testing\u201d is called \u201cverification activities.\u201d We follow that use in this book and\nit should be pointed out that this book is only concerned with dynamic or execution-\nbased testing.\n\nOne last term bears mentioning because of the lack of definition. Test Strategy\nhas been used to mean a variety of things, including coverage criterion, test process,\nand technologies used. We will avoid using it.\n\n1.5 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAll books on software testing and all researchers owe major thanks to the landmark\nbooks in 1979 by Myers [249], in 1990 by Beizer [29], and in 2000 by Binder [33].\nSome excellent overviews of unit testing criteria have also been published, including\none by White [349] and more recently by Zhu, Hall, and May [367].\n",

Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n\nCoupling was first discussed as a design metric by Constantine and Yourdon [88],\nand its use for testing was introduced implicitly by Harrold, Soffa, and Rothermel\n[152, 154] and explicitly by Jin and Offutt [178], who introduced the use of first-uses\nand last-defs.\n\nKim, Hong, Cho, Bae, and Cha used a graph-based approach to generate tests\nfrom UML state diagrams [186].\n\nThe USA\u2019s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has recognized the increased\nimportance of modularity and integration testing by imposing requirements on\nstructural coverage analysis of software that \u201cthe analysis should confirm the data\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 103\n\ncoupling and control coupling between the code components\u201d [305], p. 33, section\n6.4.4.2.\n\nData flow testing has also been applied to integration testing by Harrold and\nSoffa [154], Harrold and Rothermel [152], and Jin and Offutt [178]. This work\nfocused on class-level integration issues, but did not address inheritance or poly-\nmorphism. Data flow testing has been applied to inheritance and polymorphism in\nobject-oriented software by Alexander and Offutt [11, 10, 12], and Buy, Orso, and\nPezze [60, 281]. Gallagher and Offutt modeled classes as interacting state machines,\nand tested concurrency and communication issues among them [132].\n\nSCR was first discussed by Henninger [157], and its use in model checking and\ntesting was introduced by Atlee [20].\n\nConstructing tests from UML diagrams is a more recent development, though\nrelatively straightforward.

This technique can be limited to the unit interfaces, allowing us to restrict our\nattention to the last definitions of variables just before calls to and returns from the\ncalled units, and the first uses of variables just after calls to and returns from the\ncalled unit.\n\nFigure 2.25 illustrates the relationships that the data flow criteria will test. The\ncriteria require execution from definitions of actual parameters through calls to uses\nof formal parameters.\n\nThree types of data flow couplings have been identified. The most obvious is pa-\nrameter coupling, where parameters are passed in calls. Shared data coupling occurs\nwhen two units access the same data object as a global or other non-local variable,\nand external device coupling occurs when two units access the same external medium\nsuch as a file. In the following, all examples and discussion will be in terms of param-\neters and it will be understood that the concepts apply equally to shared data and\nexternal device coupling. We use the general term coupling variable for variables\nthat are defined in one unit and used in another.\n\nThis form of data flow is concerned only with last-defs before calls and returns\nand first-uses after calls and returns. That is, it is concerned only with defs and\nuses immediately surrounding the calls between methods. The last-defs before a\ncall are locations with defs that reach uses at callsites and the last-defs before a re-\nturn are locations with defs that reach a return statement. The following definitions\nassume a variable that is defined in either the caller or the callee, and used in the\nother.\n\nDefinition 2.40 Last-def: The set of nodes that define a variable x for which\nthere is a def-clear path from the node through the call site to a use in the\nother unit.\n\nThe variable can be passed as a parameter, a return value, or a shared variable\nreference. If the function has no return statement, an implicit return statement is\nassumed to exist at the last statement in the method.\n",

Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32.

The most obvious graph\nto create for testing these features (which we collectively call \u201cthe OO language\nfeatures\u201d) is the inheritance hierarchy. Figure 2.23 represents a small inheritance\nhierarchy with four classes. Classes C and D inherit from B, and B in turn inherits\nfrom A.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.1 can be applied to inheritance hierarchies\nin ways that are superficially simple, but have some subtle problems.

However, this seems weak because\nit says nothing about execution. The logical extension is to require that for each\nobject of each class, the call graph must be covered according to the call coverage\ncriterion above. Thus, the OO call coverage criterion can be called an \u201caggregation\ncriterion\u201d because it requires call coverage to be applied on at least one object for\neach class.\n\nAn extension of this is the all object call criterion, which requires that call cover-\nage be satisfied for every object that is instantiated for every class.\n\n2.4.2 Data Flow Graph Coverage for Design Elements\n\nControl connections among design elements are simple and straightforward and\ntests based on them are probably not very effective at finding faults.

As in Section 2.2, we first\nconsider structural coverage criteria and then data flow criteria.\n\n2.3.1 Structural Graph Coverage for Source Code\n\nThe most widely used graph coverage criteria are defined on source code. Although\nprecise details vary from one programming language to another, the basic pattern is\nthe same for most common languages. To apply one of the graph criteria, the first\nstep is to define the graph, and for source code, the most common graph is called a\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Control flow graphs associate an edge with each possible\nbranch in the program, and a node with sequences of statements. Formally, a basic\nblock is a maximum sequence of program statements such that if any one statement\nof the block is executed, all statements in the block are executed. A basic block has\nonly one entry point and one exit point. Our first example language structure is an\nif statement with an else clause, shown as Java code followed by the corresponding\nCFG in Figure 2.16. The if-else structure results in two basic blocks.\n\nNote that the two statements in the then part of the if statement both appear\nin the same node. Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node. Node n3, which has more than one\nin-edge, is called a junction node.\n",

Def-use pairs in object-oriented software.\n\nthat are indirectly defined within m() and i-uses(m) is the set of variables used by\nm().\n\nA coupling sequence is a pair of nodes that call two methods in sequence; the first\nmethod defines a variable and the second uses it. Both calls must be made through\nthe same instance object. The calling method is called the coupling method f(), and\nit calls m(), the antecedent method, to define x, and n(), the consequent method, to\nuse x. This is illustrated in Figure 7.11 (repeated from Chapter 2). If the antecedent\nor consequent method is the same as the coupling method, that is a special case that\nis handled implicitly. If the antecedent or consequent method is called from another\nmethod that is called by f(), this an indirect data flow (right side of Figure 7.11),\nwhich we do not discuss.\n\nThe control flow schematic shown in Figure 7.12 illustrates the coupling method\ncalling both the antecedent and consequent methods. The schematic abstracts away\nthe details of the control flow graph and shows only nodes that are relevant to cou-\npling analysis. The thin line segments represent control flow and the thicker lines\nindicate control flow that is part of a coupling path. The line segments can represent\nmultiple sub-paths. A path may be annotated with a transmission set such as [o, o.v],\nwhich contains variables for which the path is definition-clear.\n\nAssuming that the intervening sub-paths are def-clear with respect to the state\nvariable o.v, the path in Figure 7.12 from h to i to j to k and finally l forms a trans-\nmission path with respect to o.v. The object o is called the context variable.\n\nEvery coupling sequence s j,k has some state variables that are defined by the\nantecedent method and then used by the consequent method. This set of variables\nis the coupling set \ufffdt\n\ns j,k\nof s j,k and is defined as the intersection of those variables\n\ndefined by m() (an indirect-def or i-def) and used by n() (an indirect use or i-use)\nthrough the instance context provided by a context variable o that is bound to an\ninstance of t. Which versions of m() and n() execute is determined by the actual type\nt of the instance bound to o.

Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node.

Node n1 is some-\ntimes called a \u201cdummy node,\u201d because it does not represent any statements, but\ngives the iteration edge (n2, n1) somewhere to go. Node n1 can also be thought of as\nrepresenting a decision. A common mistake for beginners is to try to have the edge\ngo to n0; this is not correct because that would mean the initialization step is done\neach iteration of the loop. Note that the method call f(x,y) is not expanded in this\nparticular graph; we return to this issue later.\n\nNow, consider a for loop that is equivalent to the prior while loop. The graph\nbecomes a little more complicated, as shown in Figure 2.19, essentially because the\nfor structure is at a very high level of abstraction.\n\nAlthough the initialization, test, and increment of the loop control variable x are\nall on the same line in the program, they need to be associated with different nodes\nin the graph. The control flow graph for the for loop is slightly different from that\nof the while loop. Specifically, we show the increment of x in a different node than\nthe method call y = f(x,y). Technically speaking, this violates the definition of a ba-\nsic block and the two nodes should be combined, but it is often easier to develop\ntemplates for the various possible program structures and then plug the control\nflow graph for the relevant code into the correct spot in the template. Commer-\ncial tools typically do this to make the graph generation simpler. In fact, commercial\ntools often do not follow the strict definition of the basic block and sometimes add\nseemingly random nodes.

For the variable\nreference to be the same, both A() and B() must be called through the same instance\ncontext, or object reference. That is, if the calls are o.A() and o.B(), they are called\nthrough the instance context of o. If the calls are not made through the same instance\ncontext, the definition and use will be to different instances of the variable.\n\nThe right side of Figure 2.30 illustrates \u201cindirect\u201d du-pairs. In this scenario, the\ncoupling method F() calls two methods, M() and N(), which in turn call two other\nmethods, A() and B(). The def and use are in A() and B(), so the reference is indirect.\nThe analysis for indirect du-pairs is considerably more complicated than for direct\ndu-pairs. It should be obvious that there can be more than one call between the\ncoupling method and the methods with the def and use.\n\nIn OO data flow testing, the methods A() and B() could be in the same class, or\nthey could be in different classes and accessing the same global variables.\n\nFinally, Figure 2.31 illustrates du-pairs in distributed software. P1 and P2 are two\nprocesses, threads, or other distributed software components, and they call A() and\nB(), which def and use the same variable.

While\nthis sort of \u201cvery loosely coupled\u201d software can be expected to have far fewer du-\npairs, identifying them, finding def-clear paths between them, and designing test\ncases to cover them is quite complicated.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.4.\n# \u30102\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFigure 2.16.

As in Section 2.2, we first\nconsider structural coverage criteria and then data flow criteria.\n\n2.3.1 Structural Graph Coverage for Source Code\n\nThe most widely used graph coverage criteria are defined on source code. Although\nprecise details vary from one programming language to another, the basic pattern is\nthe same for most common languages. To apply one of the graph criteria, the first\nstep is to define the graph, and for source code, the most common graph is called a\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Control flow graphs associate an edge with each possible\nbranch in the program, and a node with sequences of statements. Formally, a basic\nblock is a maximum sequence of program statements such that if any one statement\nof the block is executed, all statements in the block are executed. A basic block has\nonly one entry point and one exit point. Our first example language structure is an\nif statement with an else clause, shown as Java code followed by the corresponding\nCFG in Figure 2.16. The if-else structure results in two basic blocks.\n\nNote that the two statements in the then part of the if statement both appear\nin the same node. Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node. Node n3, which has more than one\nin-edge, is called a junction node.\n\nNext we turn to the degenerate case of an if statement without an else clause,\nshown in Figure 2.17. This is the same graph previously seen in Figure 2.6, but this\ntime based on actual program statements.\n\nNote that the control flow graph for this structure has only three nodes. The\nreader should note that a test with x < y traverses all of the nodes in this control\nflow graph, but not all of the edges.\n\nRepresenting loops is a little tricky because we have to include nodes that are\nnot directly derived from program statements. The simplest kind of loop is a while\nloop with an initializing statement, as shown in Figure 2.18.

This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n\nForman also suggested a way to detect data flow anomalies without running the\nprogram [121].\n\nSome detailed problems with data flow testing have been recurring. These in-\nclude the application of data flow when paths between definitions and uses cannot\nbe executed [127], and handling pointers and arrays [267, 345].\n\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n# \u30106\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nHowever, the development above does not work if the graph\nhas definitions on edges. The problem is that a du-path from an edge to an edge is\nno longer necessarily simple, since instead of simply having a common first and last\nnode, such a du-path now might have a common first and last edge. It is possible\nto modify the definitions to explicitly mention definitions and uses on edges as well\nas nodes, but the definitions tend to get messier. The bibliographic notes contain\npointers for this type of development.\n\nFigure 2.14 illustrates the differences among the three data flow coverage cri-\nteria with the double-diamond graph. The graph has one def, so only one path is\nneeded to satisfy all-defs. The def has two uses, so two paths are needed to satisfy\nall-uses. Since two paths go from the def to each use, four paths are needed to sat-\nisfy all-du-paths. Note that the definitions of the data flow criteria leave open the\nchoice of touring. The literature uses various choices \u2013 in some cases demanding\ndirect touring, and, in other cases, allowing def-clear sidetrips. Our recommenda-\ntion is best-effort touring, a choice that, in contrast to the treatments in the litera-\nture, yields the desired subsumption relationships even in the case of infeasible test\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n50 Coverage Criteria\n\nrequirements. From a practical perspective, best-effort touring also makes sense \u2013\neach test requirement is satisfied as rigorously as possible.\n\n2.2.3 Subsumption Relationships among Graph Coverage Criteria\n\nRecall from Chapter 1 that coverage criteria are often related to one another by sub-\nsumption. The first relation to note is that edge coverage subsumes node coverage.\nIn most cases, this is because if we traverse every edge in a graph, we will visit every\nnode. However, if a graph has a node with no incoming or outgoing edges, travers-\ning every edge will not reach that node. Thus, edge coverage is defined to include\nevery path of length up to 1, that is, of length 0 (all nodes) and length 1 (all edges).\nThe subsumption does not hold in the reverse direction. Recall that Figure 2.6 gave\nan example test set that satisfied node coverage but not edge coverage. Hence, node\ncoverage does not subsume edge coverage.\n\nWe have a variety of subsumption relations among the criteria. Where applica-\nble, the structural coverage relations assume best-effort touring. Because best-effort\nTouring is assumed, the subsumption results hold even if some test requirements are\ninfeasible.\n\nThe subsumption results for data flow criteria are based on three assumptions:\n(1) every use is preceded by a def, (2) every def reaches at least one use, and (3)\nfor every node with multiple outgoing edges, at least one variable is used on each\nout edge, and the same variables are used on each out edge.

This inclusion is not necessary for\ntypical control flow graphs, where, indeed, subsumption of node coverage by edge\ncoverage is often presented as a basic theorem, but it may be required for graphs\nderived from other artifacts.\n\nSeveral later papers focused on automatic test data generation to cover struc-\ntural elements in the program [39, 41, 80, 101, 117, 166, 190, 191, 267, 295]. Much of\nthis work was based on the analysis techniques of symbolic evaluation [62, 83, 93,\n101, 116, 164], and slicing [328, 339]. Some of these ideas are discussed in Chapter 6.\n\nThe problem of handling loops has plagued graph-based criteria from the begin-\nning. It seems obvious that we want to cover paths, but loops create infinite numbers\nof paths. In Howden\u2019s 1975 paper [164], he specifically addressed loops by cover-\ning complete paths \u201cwithout looping,\u201d and Chow\u2019s 1978 suggestion to use spanning\ntrees was an explicit attempt to avoid having to execute loops [77]. Binder\u2019s book\n[33] used the technique from Chow\u2019s paper, but changed the name to round trip,\nwhich is the name used in this book.\n\nAnother early suggestion was based on testing loop free programs [66], which is\ncertainly interesting from a theoretical view, but not particularly practical.\n\nWhite and Wiszniewski [348] suggested limiting the number of loops that need to\nbe executed based on specific patterns. Weyuker, Weiss, and Hamlet tried to choose\nspecific loops to test based on data definitions and uses [345].\n\nThe notion of subpath sets was developed by Offutt et al. [178, 265] to sup-\nport inter-class path testing and is essentially equivalent to tours with detours as\npresented here. The ideas of touring, sidetrips and detours were introduced by\nAmmann, Offutt and Huang [17].\n\nThe earliest reference we have found on data flow testing was a technical report\nin 1974 by Osterweil and Fosdick [282]. This technical report was followed by a 1976\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n102 Coverage Criteria\n\npaper in ACM Computing Surveys [122], along with an almost simultaneous publi-\ncation by Herman in the Australian Computer Journal [158]. The seminal data flow\nanalysis procedure (without reference to testing) was due to Allen and Cocke [13].\n\nOther fundamental and theoretical references are by Laski and Korel in 1983\n[201], who suggested executing paths from definitions to uses, Rapps and Weyuker\nin 1985 [297], who defined criteria and introduced terms such as All-Defs and All-\nUses, and Frankl and Weyuker in 1988 [128]. These papers refined and clarified the\nidea of data flow testing, and are the basis of the presentation in this text. Stated in\nthe language in this text, [128] requires direct tours for the All-du-Paths Coverage,\nbut allows sidetrips for All-Defs coverage and All-Uses coverage. This text allows\nsidetrips (or not) for all of the data flow criteria. The pattern matching example\nused in this text has been employed in the literature for decades; as far as we know,\nFrankl and Weyuker [128] were the first to use the example for illustrating data flow\ncoverage.\n# \u30108\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n[347] Lee White, Husain Almezen, and Nasser Alzeidi.

Specifically, the \u201cat least one du-path\u201d\ndirective in All-Uses is changed to \u201cevery path\u201d in All-du-Paths. Thought of in terms\nof def-use pairs, All-Uses requires some def-clear simple path to each use, whereas\nAll-du-Paths requires all def-clear simple paths to each use.\n\nTo simplify the development above, we assumed that definitions and uses oc-\ncurred on nodes. Naturally, definitions and uses can occur on edges as well. It turns\nout that the development above also works for uses on edges, so data flow on pro-\ngram flow graphs can be easily defined (uses on program flow graph edges are some-\ntimes called \u201cp-uses\u201d). However, the development above does not work if the graph\nhas definitions on edges. The problem is that a du-path from an edge to an edge is\nno longer necessarily simple, since instead of simply having a common first and last\nnode, such a du-path now might have a common first and last edge. It is possible\nto modify the definitions to explicitly mention definitions and uses on edges as well\nas nodes, but the definitions tend to get messier. The bibliographic notes contain\npointers for this type of development.\n\nFigure 2.14 illustrates the differences among the three data flow coverage cri-\nteria with the double-diamond graph. The graph has one def, so only one path is\nneeded to satisfy all-defs. The def has two uses, so two paths are needed to satisfy\nall-uses. Since two paths go from the def to each use, four paths are needed to sat-\nisfy all-du-paths. Note that the definitions of the data flow criteria leave open the\nchoice of touring. The literature uses various choices \u2013 in some cases demanding\ndirect touring, and, in other cases, allowing def-clear sidetrips. Our recommenda-\ntion is best-effort touring, a choice that, in contrast to the treatments in the litera-\nture, yields the desired subsumption relationships even in the case of infeasible test\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n50 Coverage Criteria\n\nrequirements.

Node n1 is some-\ntimes called a \u201cdummy node,\u201d because it does not represent any statements, but\ngives the iteration edge (n2, n1) somewhere to go. Node n1 can also be thought of as\nrepresenting a decision. A common mistake for beginners is to try to have the edge\ngo to n0; this is not correct because that would mean the initialization step is done\neach iteration of the loop. Note that the method call f(x,y) is not expanded in this\nparticular graph; we return to this issue later.\n\nNow, consider a for loop that is equivalent to the prior while loop. The graph\nbecomes a little more complicated, as shown in Figure 2.19, essentially because the\nfor structure is at a very high level of abstraction.\n\nAlthough the initialization, test, and increment of the loop control variable x are\nall on the same line in the program, they need to be associated with different nodes\nin the graph. The control flow graph for the for loop is slightly different from that\nof the while loop. Specifically, we show the increment of x in a different node than\nthe method call y = f(x,y). Technically speaking, this violates the definition of a ba-\nsic block and the two nodes should be combined, but it is often easier to develop\ntemplates for the various possible program structures and then plug the control\nflow graph for the relevant code into the correct spot in the template. Commer-\ncial tools typically do this to make the graph generation simpler. In fact, commercial\ntools often do not follow the strict definition of the basic block and sometimes add\nseemingly random nodes. This can have trivial effects on the bookkeeping (for ex-\n\nx = 0;\nwhile (x < y)\n{\n   y = f (x, y);\n   x = x+1;\n}\n\nn1\n\nn3n2\n\nn0\n\nx > y\n\nx = 0\n\nx < y\n\ny = f (x, y)\nx = x + 1\n\nFigure 2.18.

The case\nstructure can be graphed either as a single node with multi-way branching or as a\nseries of if-then-else structures. We choose to illustrate the case structure with multi-\nway branching, as in Figure 2.20.\n\nThe coverage criteria from the previous section can now be applied to graphs\nfrom source code. The application is direct with only the names being changed.\nNode coverage is often called statement coverage or basic block coverage, and edge\ncoverage is often called branch coverage.\n\n2.3.2 Data Flow Graph Coverage for Source Code\n# \u301011\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe right side of Figure 2.30 illustrates \u201cindirect\u201d du-pairs. In this scenario, the\ncoupling method F() calls two methods, M() and N(), which in turn call two other\nmethods, A() and B(). The def and use are in A() and B(), so the reference is indirect.\nThe analysis for indirect du-pairs is considerably more complicated than for direct\ndu-pairs. It should be obvious that there can be more than one call between the\ncoupling method and the methods with the def and use.\n\nIn OO data flow testing, the methods A() and B() could be in the same class, or\nthey could be in different classes and accessing the same global variables.\n\nFinally, Figure 2.31 illustrates du-pairs in distributed software. P1 and P2 are two\nprocesses, threads, or other distributed software components, and they call A() and\nB(), which def and use the same variable. The distribution and communication could\nuse any of a number of methods, including HTTP (Web-based), remote method\ninvocation (RMI), or CORBA. A() and B() could be in the same class or could access\na persistent variable such as a Web session variable or permanent data store. While\nthis sort of \u201cvery loosely coupled\u201d software can be expected to have far fewer du-\npairs, identifying them, finding def-clear paths between them, and designing test\ncases to cover them is quite complicated.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.4.\n\n1.

This notion\nis refined to a coupling du-path with respect to a coupling variable x. A coupling\ndu-path is a path from a last-def to a first-use.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.2 can now be applied to coupling graphs.\nAll-Defs coverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to at least\none first-use. In this context, all-defs is called All-Coupling-Def coverage. All-Uses\ncoverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to every first-use. In\nthis context, All-Uses is also called All-Coupling-Use coverage.\n\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used.

How else could we compare test criteria besides subsumption?\n\n1.4 OLDER SOFTWARE TESTING TERMINOLOGY\n\nThe testing research community has been very active in the past two decades, and\nsome of our fundamental views of what and how to test have changed. This section\npresents some of the terminology that has been in use for many years, but for various\nreasons has become dated. Despite the fact that they are not as relevant now as they\nwere at one time, these terms are still used and it is important that testing students\nand professionals be familiar with them.\n\nFrom an abstract perspective, black-box and white-box testing are very similar.\nIn this book in particular, we present testing as proceeding from abstract models of\nthe software such as graphs, which can as easily be derived from a black-box view or\na white-box view. Thus, one of the most obvious effects of the unique philosophical\nstructure of this book is that these two terms become obsolete.\n\nDefinition 1.25 Black-box testing: Deriving tests from external descriptions\nof the software, including specifications, requirements, and design.\n\nDefinition 1.26 White-box testing: Deriving tests from the source code inter-\nnals of the software, specifically including branches, individual conditions,\nand statements.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a discussion took place over whether testing should proceed\nfrom the top down or from the bottom up. This was an echo of a previous discussion\nover how to develop software. This distinction has pretty much disappeared as we\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n22 Overview\n\nfirst learned that top-down testing is impractical, then OO design pretty much made\nthe distinction obsolete. The following pair of definitions assumes that software can\nbe viewed as a tree of software procedures, where the edges represent calls and the\nroot of the tree is the main procedure.\n\nDefinition 1.27 Top-Down Testing: Test the main procedure, then go down\nthrough procedures it calls, and so on.\n\nDefinition 1.28 Bottom-Up Testing: Test the leaves in the tree (procedures\nthat make no calls), and move up to the root. Each procedure is tested only\nif all of its children have been tested.\n\nOO software leads to a more general problem. The relationships among classes\ncan be formulated as general graphs with cycles, requiring test engineers to make\nthe difficult choice of what order to test the classes in. This problem is discussed in\nChapter 6.\n\nSome parts of the literature separate static and dynamic testing as follows:\n\nDefinition 1.29 Static Testing: Testing without executing the program. This\nincludes software inspections and some forms of analysis.\n\nDefinition 1.30 Dynamic Testing: Testing by executing the program with real\ninputs.\n\nMost of the literature currently uses \u201ctesting\u201d to refer to dynamic testing and\n\u201cstatic testing\u201d is called \u201cverification activities.\u201d We follow that use in this book and\nit should be pointed out that this book is only concerned with dynamic or execution-\nbased testing.\n\nOne last term bears mentioning because of the lack of definition. Test Strategy\nhas been used to mean a variety of things, including coverage criterion, test process,\nand technologies used. We will avoid using it.\n\n1.5 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAll books on software testing and all researchers owe major thanks to the landmark\nbooks in 1979 by Myers [249], in 1990 by Beizer [29], and in 2000 by Binder [33].\nSome excellent overviews of unit testing criteria have also been published, including\none by White [349] and more recently by Zhu, Hall, and May [367].\n# \u301014\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe method of defining data flow criteria in terms of sets of du-paths is original\nto this book, as is the explicit suggestion for best-effort eouring.\n\nMany papers present empirical studies of various aspects of data flow testing.\nOne of the earliest was by Clarke, Podgurski, Richardson, and Zeil, who compared\nsome of the different criteria [82]. Comparisons with mutation testing (introduced\nin Chapter 5) started with Mathur in 1991 [228], which was followed by Mathur and\nWong [230], Wong and Mathur [357], Offutt, Pan, Tewary, and Zhang [274], and\nFrankl, Weiss, and Hu [125]. Comparisons of data flow with other test criteria have\nbeen published by Frankl and Weiss [124], Hutchins, Foster, Goradia, and Ostrand\n[172], and Frankl and Deng [123].\n\nA number of tools have also been built by researchers to support data flow test-\ning. Most worked by taking a program and tests as inputs, and deciding whether\none or more data flow criteria have been satisfied (a recognizer). Frankl, Weiss, and\nWeyuker built ASSET in the mid 1980s [126], Girgis and Woodward built a tool to\nimplement both data flow and mutation testing in the mid 1980s [134], and Laski\nbuilt STAD in the late 1980s [200]. Researchers at Bellcore developed the ATAC\ndata flow tool for C programs in the early 1990s [161, 162], and the first tool that\nincluded a test data generator for data flow criteria was built by Offutt, Jin, and Pan\nin the late 1990s [267].\n\nCoupling was first discussed as a design metric by Constantine and Yourdon [88],\nand its use for testing was introduced implicitly by Harrold, Soffa, and Rothermel\n[152, 154] and explicitly by Jin and Offutt [178], who introduced the use of first-uses\nand last-defs.\n\nKim, Hong, Cho, Bae, and Cha used a graph-based approach to generate tests\nfrom UML state diagrams [186].\n\nThe USA\u2019s Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has recognized the increased\nimportance of modularity and integration testing by imposing requirements on\nstructural coverage analysis of software that \u201cthe analysis should confirm the data\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 103\n\ncoupling and control coupling between the code components\u201d [305], p. 33, section\n6.4.4.2.\n\nData flow testing has also been applied to integration testing by Harrold and\nSoffa [154], Harrold and Rothermel [152], and Jin and Offutt [178]. This work\nfocused on class-level integration issues, but did not address inheritance or poly-\nmorphism. Data flow testing has been applied to inheritance and polymorphism in\nobject-oriented software by Alexander and Offutt [11, 10, 12], and Buy, Orso, and\nPezze [60, 281]. Gallagher and Offutt modeled classes as interacting state machines,\nand tested concurrency and communication issues among them [132].\n\nSCR was first discussed by Henninger [157], and its use in model checking and\ntesting was introduced by Atlee [20].\n\nConstructing tests from UML diagrams is a more recent development, though\nrelatively straightforward. It was first suggested by Abdurazik and Offutt [2, 264],\nand soon followed by Briand and Labiche [45].\n# \u301015\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAn extension of this is the all object call criterion, which requires that call cover-\nage be satisfied for every object that is instantiated for every class.\n\n2.4.2 Data Flow Graph Coverage for Design Elements\n\nControl connections among design elements are simple and straightforward and\ntests based on them are probably not very effective at finding faults. On the other\nhand, data flow connections are often very complex and difficult to analyze. For\na tester, that should immediately suggest that they are a rich source for software\nfaults. The primary issue is where the defs and uses occur. When testing program\nunits, the defs and uses are in the same unit. During integration testing, defs and\nuses are in different units. This section starts with some standard compiler/program\nanalysis terms.\n\nA caller is a unit that invokes another unit, the callee. The statement that makes\nthe call is the call site. An actual parameter is in the caller; its value is assigned to\na formal parameter in the callee. The interface between two units is the mapping of\nactual to formal parameters.\n\nThe underlying premise of the data flow testing criteria for design elements is\nthat to achieve confidence in the interfaces between integrated program units, it\nmust be ensured that variables defined in caller units be appropriately used in callee\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n68 Coverage Criteria\n\nA\n\nend B\n\nB (Y)\n\nend A\n\nB (X)\n\nCaller\n\nCallee\n\nActual Parameters\n\nFormal Parameters\n\nInterface{ ...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nFigure 2.25. An example of parameter\ncoupling.\n\nunits. This technique can be limited to the unit interfaces, allowing us to restrict our\nattention to the last definitions of variables just before calls to and returns from the\ncalled units, and the first uses of variables just after calls to and returns from the\ncalled unit.\n\nFigure 2.25 illustrates the relationships that the data flow criteria will test. The\ncriteria require execution from definitions of actual parameters through calls to uses\nof formal parameters.\n\nThree types of data flow couplings have been identified. The most obvious is pa-\nrameter coupling, where parameters are passed in calls. Shared data coupling occurs\nwhen two units access the same data object as a global or other non-local variable,\nand external device coupling occurs when two units access the same external medium\nsuch as a file. In the following, all examples and discussion will be in terms of param-\neters and it will be understood that the concepts apply equally to shared data and\nexternal device coupling. We use the general term coupling variable for variables\nthat are defined in one unit and used in another.\n\nThis form of data flow is concerned only with last-defs before calls and returns\nand first-uses after calls and returns. That is, it is concerned only with defs and\nuses immediately surrounding the calls between methods. The last-defs before a\ncall are locations with defs that reach uses at callsites and the last-defs before a re-\nturn are locations with defs that reach a return statement. The following definitions\nassume a variable that is defined in either the caller or the callee, and used in the\nother.\n\nDefinition 2.40 Last-def: The set of nodes that define a variable x for which\nthere is a def-clear path from the node through the call site to a use in the\nother unit.\n\nThe variable can be passed as a parameter, a return value, or a shared variable\nreference. If the function has no return statement, an implicit return statement is\nassumed to exist at the last statement in the method.\n# \u301016\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used. The complete set of coupling\ndu-pairs for class Quadratic is\n\n(main(), X, 16) -- (Root(), A, 47)\n(main(), Y, 17) -- (Root(), B, 47)\n(main(), Z, 18) -- (Root(), C, 47)\n(main(), X, 23) -- (Root(), A, 47)\n(main(), Y, 24) -- (Root(), B, 47)\n(main(), Z, 25) -- (Root(), C, 47)\n(main(), X, 30) -- (Root(), A, 47)\n(main(), Y, 31) -- (Root(), B, 47)\n(main(), Z, 32) -- (Root(), C, 47)\n(Root(), Root1, 53) -- (main(), Root1, 37)\n(Root(), Root2, 54) -- (main(), Root2, 37)\n(Root(), Result, 50) -- (main(), ok, 35)\n(Root(), Result, 55) -- (main(), ok, 35)\n\nA couple of notes are important to remember about coupling data flow. First,\nonly variables that are used or defined in the callee are considered. That is, last-defs\nthat have no corresponding first-uses are not useful for testing. Second, we must\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 71\n# \u301017\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nAs\nof this writing, it is still not clear how best to test these language features or what\ncriteria are appropriate. This text introduces the current state of knowledge; the\ninterested reader is encouraged to keep up with the literature for continuing results\nand techniques for testing OO software. The bibliographic notes give some current\nreferences, and further ideas are discussed in Chapter 7. The most obvious graph\nto create for testing these features (which we collectively call \u201cthe OO language\nfeatures\u201d) is the inheritance hierarchy. Figure 2.23 represents a small inheritance\nhierarchy with four classes. Classes C and D inherit from B, and B in turn inherits\nfrom A.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.1 can be applied to inheritance hierarchies\nin ways that are superficially simple, but have some subtle problems. In OO pro-\ngramming, classes are not directly tested because they are not executable. In fact, the\nedges in the inheritance hierarchy do not represent execution flow at all, but rather\ninheritance dependencies. To apply any type of coverage, we first need a model for\n\nA\n\nDC\n\nB\n\nFigure 2.23.

An inher-\nitance hierarchy with\nobjects instantiated.\n\nwhat coverage means. The first step is to require that objects be instantiated for\nsome or all of the classes. Figure 2.24 shows the inheritance hierarchy from Figure\n2.23 with one object instantiated for each class.\n\nThe most obvious interpretation of node coverage for this graph is to require\nthat at least one object be created for each class. However, this seems weak because\nit says nothing about execution. The logical extension is to require that for each\nobject of each class, the call graph must be covered according to the call coverage\ncriterion above. Thus, the OO call coverage criterion can be called an \u201caggregation\ncriterion\u201d because it requires call coverage to be applied on at least one object for\neach class.\n\nAn extension of this is the all object call criterion, which requires that call cover-\nage be satisfied for every object that is instantiated for every class.\n\n2.4.2 Data Flow Graph Coverage for Design Elements\n\nControl connections among design elements are simple and straightforward and\ntests based on them are probably not very effective at finding faults. On the other\nhand, data flow connections are often very complex and difficult to analyze. For\na tester, that should immediately suggest that they are a rich source for software\nfaults. The primary issue is where the defs and uses occur. When testing program\nunits, the defs and uses are in the same unit. During integration testing, defs and\nuses are in different units. This section starts with some standard compiler/program\nanalysis terms.\n\nA caller is a unit that invokes another unit, the callee. The statement that makes\nthe call is the call site. An actual parameter is in the caller; its value is assigned to\na formal parameter in the callee. The interface between two units is the mapping of\nactual to formal parameters.\n\nThe underlying premise of the data flow testing criteria for design elements is\nthat to achieve confidence in the interfaces between integrated program units, it\nmust be ensured that variables defined in caller units be appropriately used in callee\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n68 Coverage Criteria\n\nA\n\nend B\n\nB (Y)\n\nend A\n# \u301018\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nuse(x) = {5, 6} // Assume the use of x in 5 pre-\ncedes the def\n\nTest Paths: Test Paths:\nt1 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 6] t1 = [1, 2, 6]\nt2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6] t2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 2, 6]\n\nt3 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]\n\n(a) Draw the graph.\n(b) List all of the du-paths with respect to x.

As in Section 2.2, we first\nconsider structural coverage criteria and then data flow criteria.\n\n2.3.1 Structural Graph Coverage for Source Code\n\nThe most widely used graph coverage criteria are defined on source code. Although\nprecise details vary from one programming language to another, the basic pattern is\nthe same for most common languages. To apply one of the graph criteria, the first\nstep is to define the graph, and for source code, the most common graph is called a\ncontrol flow graph (CFG). Control flow graphs associate an edge with each possible\nbranch in the program, and a node with sequences of statements. Formally, a basic\nblock is a maximum sequence of program statements such that if any one statement\nof the block is executed, all statements in the block are executed. A basic block has\nonly one entry point and one exit point. Our first example language structure is an\nif statement with an else clause, shown as Java code followed by the corresponding\nCFG in Figure 2.16. The if-else structure results in two basic blocks.\n\nNote that the two statements in the then part of the if statement both appear\nin the same node. Node n0, which represents the conditional test x < y has more\nthan one out-edge, and is called a decision node. Node n3, which has more than one\nin-edge, is called a junction node.\n# \u301019\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFigure 7.11. Def-use pairs in object-oriented software.\n\nthat are indirectly defined within m() and i-uses(m) is the set of variables used by\nm().\n\nA coupling sequence is a pair of nodes that call two methods in sequence; the first\nmethod defines a variable and the second uses it. Both calls must be made through\nthe same instance object. The calling method is called the coupling method f(), and\nit calls m(), the antecedent method, to define x, and n(), the consequent method, to\nuse x. This is illustrated in Figure 7.11 (repeated from Chapter 2). If the antecedent\nor consequent method is the same as the coupling method, that is a special case that\nis handled implicitly. If the antecedent or consequent method is called from another\nmethod that is called by f(), this an indirect data flow (right side of Figure 7.11),\nwhich we do not discuss.\n\nThe control flow schematic shown in Figure 7.12 illustrates the coupling method\ncalling both the antecedent and consequent methods. The schematic abstracts away\nthe details of the control flow graph and shows only nodes that are relevant to cou-\npling analysis. The thin line segments represent control flow and the thicker lines\nindicate control flow that is part of a coupling path. The line segments can represent\nmultiple sub-paths. A path may be annotated with a transmission set such as [o, o.v],\nwhich contains variables for which the path is definition-clear.\n\nAssuming that the intervening sub-paths are def-clear with respect to the state\nvariable o.v, the path in Figure 7.12 from h to i to j to k and finally l forms a trans-\nmission path with respect to o.v. The object o is called the context variable.\n\nEvery coupling sequence s j,k has some state variables that are defined by the\nantecedent method and then used by the consequent method. This set of variables\nis the coupling set \ufffdt\n\ns j,k\nof s j,k and is defined as the intersection of those variables\n\ndefined by m() (an indirect-def or i-def) and used by n() (an indirect use or i-use)\nthrough the instance context provided by a context variable o that is bound to an\ninstance of t. Which versions of m() and n() execute is determined by the actual type\nt of the instance bound to o. The members of the coupling set are called coupling\nvariables.\n\nCoupling sequences require that there be at least one def-clear path between\neach node in the sequence. Identifying these paths as parts of complete sequences of\nnodes results in the set of coupling paths. A coupling path is considered to transmit\na def of a variable to a use.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 251\n\nCoupling\nMethod\n\ni o.m()\n\nk o.n()\n\nj def(o.v)\n\nh def(o)\n\nm()\n\nf()\n\nn()\n\nl use(o.v)\n\nCoupling\nSequence\n\n sj,k\n\nwith\nrespect\nto o.v\n\ntransmission \npath[o, o.v ]\n\n[o]\n\ni-def path\n[o.v ]\n\ni-use path\n[o.v ]\n\nAntecedent\nNode\n\nConsequent\nNode\n\nCoupling Context\n\nCall site\nCall return\nMethod entry\n\nStatement\nControl Flow\nCoupling Path\n\nMethod exit\n\nTransmission set[...]\n\nAntecedent\nMethod\n\nConsequent\nMethod\n\nFigure 7.12.

As is usual\nin the testing literature, we divide these criteria into two types. The first are usually\nreferred to as control flow coverage criteria. Because we generalize this situation,\nwe call them structural graph coverage criteria. The other criteria are based on the\nflow of data through the software artifact represented by the graph and are called\ndata flow coverage criteria. Following the discussion in Chapter 1, we identify the\nappropriate test requirements and then define each criterion in terms of the test re-\nquirements. In general, for any graph-based coverage criterion, the idea is to identify\nthe test requirements in terms of various structures in the graph.\n\nFor graphs, coverage criteria define test requirements, TR, in terms of properties\nof test paths in a graph G. A typical test requirement is met by visiting a particular\nnode or edge or by touring a particular path. The definitions we have given so far for\na visit are adequate, but the notion of a tour requires more development. We return\nto the issue of touring later in this chapter and then refine it further in the context\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 33\n\nof data flow criteria. The following definition is a refinement of the definition of\ncoverage given in Chapter 1:\n\nDefinition 2.32 Graph Coverage: Given a set TR of test requirements for a\ngraph criterion C, a test set T satisfies C on graph G if and only if for every\ntest requirement tr in TR, there is at least one test path p in path(T) such\nthat p meets tr .\n\nThis is a very general statement that must be refined for individual cases.\n\n2.2.1 Structural Coverage Criteria\n\nWe specify graph coverage criteria by specifying a set of test requirements, TR. We\nwill start by defining criteria to visit every node and then every edge in a graph.\nThe first criterion is probably familiar and is based on the old notion of executing\nevery statement in a program. This concept has variously been called \u201cstatement\ncoverage,\u201d \u201cblock coverage,\u201d \u201cstate coverage,\u201d and \u201cnode coverage.\u201d We use the\ngeneral graph term \u201cnode coverage.\u201d Although this concept is familiar and simple,\nwe introduce some additional notation. The notation initially seems to complicate\nthe criterion, but ultimately has the effect of making subsequent criteria cleaner and\nmathematically precise, avoiding confusion with more complicated situations.\n\nThe requirements that are produced by a graph criterion are technically pred-\nicates that can have either the value true (the requirement has been met) or false\n(the requirement has not been met). For the double-diamond graph in Figure 2.3,\nthe test requirements for node coverage are: TR = { visit n0, visit n1, visit n2,\n# \u30102\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nInstrumenting for edge coverage is only slightly more complicated than for node\ncoverage. Each edge in the graph is assigned a unique identifier number. An array\nis created that is indexed by the edge numbers (edgeCover []). Next the following\ninstrument is inserted onto each edge i: \u201cedgeCover[i]++;.\u201d\n\nThis process is illustrated in Figure 8.3. As with node coverage, the edgeCover[]\narray must be read before execution starts. Each node in Figure 8.3 is anno-\ntated with \u201cec\u201d as an abbreviation for \u201cedgeCover.\u201d The instrumentation for some\nedges is sometimes omitted if coverage is implied by another. For example, in Fig-\nure 8.3, any test that causes edge 3 to be executed will also cause edge 5 to be\nexecuted.\n\nSome structures do not explicitly represent all edges. For example, the follow-\ning program source does not have a location for the instrumentation on the else\nedge:\n\nif (isPrime)\n{ // save it!\n\nprimes[numPrimes] = curPrime;\nnumPrimes++;\n\n}\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nBuilding Testing Tools 271\n\nTherefore the else clause must be explicitly added to instrument for branch cov-\nerage:\n\nif (isPrime)\n{ // save it!\n\nprimes[numPrimes] = curPrime;\nnumPrimes++;\n\n}\nelse\n\nedgeCover[5]++;\n\n8.1.2 Data Flow Coverage\n\nData flow coverage is somewhat more complicated than node and edge coverage.\nThe primary difference is that the criterion is based on two locations in the program:\none for the definition and one for the use. As with node coverage, each node is\nassigned a unique number, but two arrays are used. Since edges can also contain\nuses, each edge must also be assigned a unique number. The technique is to use one\narray to keep track of definitions and another to keep track of uses.\n\nAt each location where variable x is defined, the statement \u201cdefCover[x] = i;\u201d is\nadded, where i is the node number. This means that defCover[x] will store the last\nlocation where x was defined. The second array keeps track of uses. For a variable\nx, useCover[] stores uses on a node or edge. For each node or edge i where a variable\nx is used, the statement \u201cuseCover[i, x, defCover[x]]++;\u201d is added. The array loca-\ntion useCover[i, x, defCover[x]] indicates that x is used at node (or edge) i and the\ndefinition from node defCover[x] has reached the use at i.\n\nFigure 8.4 illustrates instrumentation for All-uses. Variables x and y are defined\n(through parameter passing or assignments) at node 1 and y is redefined at node\n2. Variable x is used at nodes 4 and 5 and y is used at node 6.

This type of testing is used to verify that\nthe system is not changed by certain inputs. Shortly we will formalize this notion as\nround trip coverage.\n\nBefore defining round trip coverage, we need a few more definitions. A path\nfrom ni to nj is simple if no node appears more than once in the path, with the\nexception that the first and last nodes may be identical. That is, simple paths have\nno internal loops, although the entire path itself may wind up being a loop. One\nuseful aspect of simple paths is that any path can be created by composing simple\npaths.\n\nEven fairly small programs may have a very large number of simple paths. Most\nof these simple paths aren\u2019t worth addressing explicitly since they are subpaths of\nother simple paths. For a coverage criterion for simple paths we would like to avoid\nenumerating the entire set of simple paths. To this end we list only maximal length\nsimple paths. To clarify this notion, we introduce a formal definition for a maximal\nlength simple path, which we call a prime path, and we adopt the name \u201cprime\u201d for\nthe criterion:\n\nDefinition 2.35 Prime Path: A path from ni to nj is a prime path if it is a\nsimple path and it does not appear as a proper subpath of any other simple\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.4 Prime Path Coverage (PPC): TR contains each prime path in G.\n\nWhile this definition of prime path coverage has the practical advantage of keep-\ning the number of test requirements down, it suffers from the problem that a given\ninfeasible prime path may well incorporate many feasible simple paths. The solution\nis direct: replace the infeasible prime path with relevant feasible subpaths. For the\npurposes of this textbook, we choose not to include this aspect of prime path cover-\nage formally in the definition, but we assume it in later theoretical characterizations\nof prime path coverage.\n\nPrime path coverage has two special cases that we include below for histor-\nical reasons. From a practical perspective, it is usually better simply to adopt\nprime path coverage. Both special cases involve treatment of loops with \u201cround\ntrips.\u201d\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n36 Coverage Criteria\n\nA round trip path is a prime path of nonzero length that starts and ends at the\nsame node. One type of round trip test coverage requires at least one round trip\npath to be taken for each node, and another requires all possible round trip paths.\n\nCriterion 2.5 Simple Round Trip Coverage (SRTC): TR contains at least one\nround-trip path for each reachable node in G that begins and ends a round-trip\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.6 Complete Round Trip Coverage (CRTC): TR contains all round-\ntrip paths for each reachable node in G.\n\nNext we turn to path coverage, which is traditional in the testing literature.\n\nCriterion 2.7 Complete Path Coverage (CPC): TR contains all paths in G.\n# \u30104\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThis process is guaranteed to terminate because the length of the longest pos-\nsible prime path is the number of nodes. Although graphs often have many simple\npaths (32 in this example, of which 8 are prime), they can usually be toured with\nfar fewer test paths. Many possible algorithms can find test paths to tour the prime\npaths. Observation will suffice with a graph as simple as in Figure 2.10. For example,\nit can be seen that the four test paths [0, 1, 5, 6], [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6], [0, 4, 6],\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n42 Coverage Criteria\n\nand [0, 4, 4, 6] are enough. This approach, however, is error-prone. The easiest thing\nto do is to tour the loop [1, 2, 3] only once, which omits the prime paths [2, 3, 1, 2]\nand [3, 1, 2, 3].\n\nWith more complicated graphs, a mechanical approach is needed. We recom-\nmend starting with the longest prime paths and extending them to the begin-\nning and end nodes in the graph. For our example, this results in the test path\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]. The test path [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] tours 3 prime paths 25, 27, and 32.\n\nThe next test path is constructed by extending one of the longest remaining\nprime paths; we will continue to work backward and choose 30. The resulting test\npath is [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6], which tours 2 prime paths, 28 and 30 (it also tours\npaths 25 and 27).\n\nThe next test path is constructed by using the prime path 26 [0, 1, 5, 6]. This test\npath tours only maximal prime path 26.\n\nContinuing in this fashion yields two more test paths, [0, 4, 6] for prime path 19,\nand [0, 4, 4, 6] for prime path 14.\n\nThe complete set of test paths is then:\n\n1) [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n2) [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n3) [0, 1, 5, 6]\n4) [0, 4, 6]\n5) [0, 4, 4, 6]\n\nThis can be used as is, or optimized if the tester desires a smaller test set. It\nis clear that test path 2 tours the prime paths toured by test path 1, so 1 can be\neliminated, leaving the four test paths identified informally earlier in this section.\nSimple algorithms can automate this process.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.2.1.\n\n1. Redefine edge coverage in the standard way (see the discussion for node cov-\nerage).\n\n2.

Figure 2.7 contrasts prime path\ncoverage with complete path coverage. Part (a) of the figure shows the \u201cdiamond\u201d\ngraph, which contains no loops. Both complete path coverage and prime path cov-\nerage can be satisfied on this graph with the two paths shown. Part (b), however,\nincludes a loop from n1 to n3 to n4 to n1, thus the graph has an infinite number of\npossible test paths, and complete path coverage is not possible. The requirements\nfor prime path coverage, however, can be toured with two test paths, for example,\n[n0, n1, n2] and [n0, n1, n3, n4, n1, n3, n4, n1, n2].\n\nTouring, Sidetrips, and Detours\nAn important but subtle point to note is that while simple paths do not have internal\nloops, we do not require the test paths that tour a simple path to have this property.\nThat is, we distinguish between the path that specifies a test requirement and the\nportion of the test path that meets the requirement. The advantage of separating\nthese two notions has to do with the issue of infeasible test requirements. Before\ndescribing this advantage, let us refine the notion of a tour.\n\nWe previously defined \u201cvisits\u201d and \u201ctours,\u201d and recall that using a path p to tour\na subpath [n1, n2, n3] means that the subpath is a subpath of p. This is a rather strict\ndefinition because each node and edge in the subpath must be visited exactly in the\norder that they appear in the subpath. We would like to relax this a bit to allow\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 37\n\n(a) Prime Path Coverage on a\nGraph with No Loops\n\n(b) Prime Path Coverage on a\nGraph with Loops\n\nPrime Paths = { [n0, n1, n3], [n0, n2, n3] }\n\npath (t1)  = [n0, n1, n3]\n\npath (t2)  = [n0, n2, n3]\n\nT1 = {t1, t2}\n\nT1 satisfies prime path coverage on the graph\n\nPrime Paths = { [n0, n1, n2],\n\n               [n0, n1, n3, n4], [n1, n3, n4, n1],\n\n               [n3, n4, n1, n3], [n4, n1, n3, n4],\n\n               [n3, n4, n1, n2] }\n\npath (t3)  = [n0, n1, n2]\n\npath (t4)  = [n0, n1, n3, n4, n1, n3, n4, n1, n2]\n\nT2 = {t3, t4}\n\nT2 satisfies prime path coverage on the graph\n\nn0\n\nn2n1\n\nn3\n\nn0\n\nn3\n\nn1\n\nn2\n\nn4\n\nFigure 2.7.

The solution\nis direct: replace the infeasible prime path with relevant feasible subpaths. For the\npurposes of this textbook, we choose not to include this aspect of prime path cover-\nage formally in the definition, but we assume it in later theoretical characterizations\nof prime path coverage.\n\nPrime path coverage has two special cases that we include below for histor-\nical reasons. From a practical perspective, it is usually better simply to adopt\nprime path coverage. Both special cases involve treatment of loops with \u201cround\ntrips.\u201d\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n36 Coverage Criteria\n\nA round trip path is a prime path of nonzero length that starts and ends at the\nsame node. One type of round trip test coverage requires at least one round trip\npath to be taken for each node, and another requires all possible round trip paths.\n\nCriterion 2.5 Simple Round Trip Coverage (SRTC): TR contains at least one\nround-trip path for each reachable node in G that begins and ends a round-trip\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.6 Complete Round Trip Coverage (CRTC): TR contains all round-\ntrip paths for each reachable node in G.\n\nNext we turn to path coverage, which is traditional in the testing literature.\n\nCriterion 2.7 Complete Path Coverage (CPC): TR contains all paths in G.\n\nSadly, complete path coverage is useless if a graph has a cycle, since this results\nin an infinite number of paths, and hence an infinite number of test requirements.\nA variant of this criterion is, however, useful. Suppose that instead of requiring all\npaths, we consider a specified set of paths. For example, these paths might be given\nby a customer in the form of usage scenarios.\n\nCriterion 2.8 Specified Path Coverage (SPC): TR contains a set S of test paths,\nwhere S is supplied as a parameter.\n\nComplete path coverage is not feasible for graphs with cycles; hence the reason\nfor developing the other alternatives listed above. Figure 2.7 contrasts prime path\ncoverage with complete path coverage. Part (a) of the figure shows the \u201cdiamond\u201d\ngraph, which contains no loops. Both complete path coverage and prime path cov-\nerage can be satisfied on this graph with the two paths shown. Part (b), however,\nincludes a loop from n1 to n3 to n4 to n1, thus the graph has an infinite number of\npossible test paths, and complete path coverage is not possible. The requirements\nfor prime path coverage, however, can be toured with two test paths, for example,\n[n0, n1, n2] and [n0, n1, n3, n4, n1, n3, n4, n1, n2].\n\nTouring, Sidetrips, and Detours\nAn important but subtle point to note is that while simple paths do not have internal\nloops, we do not require the test paths that tour a simple path to have this property.\nThat is, we distinguish between the path that specifies a test requirement and the\nportion of the test path that meets the requirement. The advantage of separating\nthese two notions has to do with the issue of infeasible test requirements. Before\ndescribing this advantage, let us refine the notion of a tour.\n# \u30109\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n8.1 INSTRUMENTATION FOR GRAPH AND LOGICAL\nEXPRESSION CRITERIA\n\nThe primary mechanism used to measure coverage is instrumentation. An instru-\nment is additional program code that does not change the functional behavior of\nthe program but collects some additional information. The instrument can affect\nthe timing in a real-time system, and could also affect concurrency. Thus, such ap-\nplications require special attention. Careful design can make instrumentation very\nefficient.\n\nFor test criteria coverage, the additional information is whether individual test\nrequirements have been met. An initial example of instrumentation is shown in\nFigure 8.1. It illustrates a statement that is added to record if the body of an \u201cif-\nblock\u201d has been reached.\n\n8.1.1 Node and Edge Coverage\n\nOne of the simplest criteria to instrument for is node coverage. This method most\nobviously works with node coverage on program source, but the general idea works\nwith arbitrary graphs. Each node in the graph is assigned a unique identifier number.\n\n268\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nBuilding Testing Tools 269\n\nOriginal Function With Instrument\n\npublic int min (A, B) public int min (A, B)\n{ {\n\nint m = A; int m = A;\nif (A > B) if (A > B)\n{ {\n\nm = B; Mark: \u201cif body has been reached\u201d\n} m = B;\nreturn (m); }\n\n} return (m);\n}\n\nFigure 8.1 Initial example of instrumentation.\n\nAn array is created that is indexed by the node numbers (called nodeCover []). Next,\nthe following instrument is inserted at each node i: \u201cnodeCover [i]++;.\u201d\n\nIt is important that the nodeCover[] array be \u201cpersistent,\u201d that is, it must be saved\nto disk after each test case. This allows results to be accumulated across multiple\ntest cases. After some tests have been executed, every node i for which nodeCover[i]\nis zero has not been covered. If nodeCover[i] is not zero, its value represents the\nnumber of times node i was reached.\n\nThis process is shown in Figure 8.2. The nodeCover[] array must be read before\nexecution starts and is shown on node 1 in the figure. Each node is annotated with\nthe appropriate instrumentation (\u201cnc\u201d is used as an abbreviation for \u201cnodeCover\u201d).\nAn automated coverage analysis tool can insert the instruments at the beginning\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4 5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\nint nodeCover [ ] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}\n\nRead (nodeCover [ ]);\nnodeCover [1] ++;\n\nnc [3]++;\n\nnc [5]++;\n\nnc [9]++;\n\nnc [6]++;\n\nnc [10]++;\n\nnc [8]++;\n\nnc [7]++;nc [4]++;\n\nnc [2]++;\n\nFigure 8.2.

For ex-\nample, one requirement is that each path of length (up to) two be toured by some\ntest path. With this context, node coverage could be redefined to contain each path\nof length zero. Clearly, this idea can be extended to paths of any length, although\npossibly with diminishing returns. We formally define one of these criteria; others\nare left as exercises for the interested reader.\n\nCriterion 2.3 Edge-Pair Coverage (EPC): TR contains each reachable path of\nlength up to 2, inclusive, in G.\n\nOne useful testing criterion is to start the software in some state (that is, a node\nin the finite state machine) and then follow transitions (that is, edges) so that the\nlast state is the same as the start state. This type of testing is used to verify that\nthe system is not changed by certain inputs. Shortly we will formalize this notion as\nround trip coverage.\n\nBefore defining round trip coverage, we need a few more definitions. A path\nfrom ni to nj is simple if no node appears more than once in the path, with the\nexception that the first and last nodes may be identical. That is, simple paths have\nno internal loops, although the entire path itself may wind up being a loop. One\nuseful aspect of simple paths is that any path can be created by composing simple\npaths.\n\nEven fairly small programs may have a very large number of simple paths. Most\nof these simple paths aren\u2019t worth addressing explicitly since they are subpaths of\nother simple paths. For a coverage criterion for simple paths we would like to avoid\nenumerating the entire set of simple paths. To this end we list only maximal length\nsimple paths. To clarify this notion, we introduce a formal definition for a maximal\nlength simple path, which we call a prime path, and we adopt the name \u201cprime\u201d for\nthe criterion:\n\nDefinition 2.35 Prime Path: A path from ni to nj is a prime path if it is a\nsimple path and it does not appear as a proper subpath of any other simple\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.4 Prime Path Coverage (PPC): TR contains each prime path in G.\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n34 Coverage Criteria\n\npath (t1 ) = [ n0, n1, n2 ]\npath (t2 ) = [ n0,  n2 ]\n\nn0\n\nn1\n\nn2\n\n x < y \n\n x > y \n\nT1 = { t1 }\nT1 satisfies node coverage on the graph\n\n(a) Node Coverage\n\nT2 = { t1 , t2 }\nT2 satisfies edge coverage on the graph\n\n(b) Edge Coverage\n\nFigure 2.6.

We choose the intermediate definition because it is more compact,\navoids the extra verbiage in a standard coverage definition, and focuses just on the\npart of the definition of coverage that changes from criterion to criterion.\n\nNode coverage is implemented in many commercial testing tools, most often in\nthe form of statement coverage.

This notion\nis refined to a coupling du-path with respect to a coupling variable x. A coupling\ndu-path is a path from a last-def to a first-use.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.2 can now be applied to coupling graphs.\nAll-Defs coverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to at least\none first-use. In this context, all-defs is called All-Coupling-Def coverage. All-Uses\ncoverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to every first-use. In\nthis context, All-Uses is also called All-Coupling-Use coverage.\n\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used. The complete set of coupling\ndu-pairs for class Quadratic is\n# \u301016\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nDefinition 2.33 Node Coverage (Formal Definition): For each node\nn \u2208 reachG(N0), TR contains the predicate \u201cvisit n.\u201d\n\nThis notation, although mathematically precise, is too cumbersome for practical\nuse. Thus we choose to introduce a simpler version of the definition that abstracts\nthe issue of predicates in the test requirements.\n\nCriterion 2.1 Node Coverage (NC): TR contains each reachable node in G.\n\nWith this definition, it is left as understood that the term \u201ccontains\u201d actually\nmeans \u201ccontains the predicate visitn.\u201d This simplification allows us to simplify the\nwriting of the test requirements for Figure 2.3 to only contain the nodes: TR = {n0,\nn1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6}. Test path p1 = [n0, n1, n3, n4, n6] meets the first, second,\nfourth, fifth, and seventh test requirements, and test path p2 = [n0, n2, n3, n5, n6]\nmeets the first, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh. Therefore, if a test set T contains\n{t1, t2}, where path(t1) = p1 and path(t2) = p2, then T satisfies node coverage on G.\n\nThe usual definition of node coverage omits the intermediate step of explicitly\nidentifying the test requirements, and is often stated as given below. Notice the\neconomy of the form used above with respect to the standard definition.

We choose the intermediate definition because it is more compact,\navoids the extra verbiage in a standard coverage definition, and focuses just on the\npart of the definition of coverage that changes from criterion to criterion.\n\nNode coverage is implemented in many commercial testing tools, most often in\nthe form of statement coverage. So is the next common criterion of edge coverage,\nusually implemented as branch coverage:\n\nCriterion 2.2 Edge Coverage (EC): TR contains each reachable path of length\nup to 1, inclusive, in G.\n# \u301017\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nExcept for nondeterministic structures, which we do not consider until Chap-\nter 7, each test case will tour exactly one test path in graph G.

Some edges are annotated with predicates that\ndescribe the conditions under which that edge is traversed. (This notion is formal-\nized later in this chapter.) So, in the example, if a is less than b, the only path is from\nn0 to n1 and then on to n3 and n2. This book describes all of the graph coverage crite-\nria in terms of relationships of test paths to the graph in question, but it is important\nto realize that testing is carried out with test cases, and that the test path is simply a\nmodel of the test case in the abstraction captured by the graph.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n32 Coverage Criteria\n\n \n\n  (a) Graph for testing the case with input integers\na, b and output (a+b)\n\n(b) Mapping between test cases and test paths\n\nS1\n\na<b\n\na=b\n\nn0\nn1\n\nn3n2\n\na>b\n\n[ Test path p2 : n0, n3, n2 ]\n\n[ Test path p3 : n0, n2 ]\n\nTest case t1 : (a=0, b=1)\nMap to\n\nTest case t2 : (a=1, b=1)\n\nTest case t3 : (a=2, b=1)\n\n[ Test path p1 : n0, n1, n3, n2 ]\n\nFigure 2.5.

As is usual\nin the testing literature, we divide these criteria into two types. The first are usually\nreferred to as control flow coverage criteria. Because we generalize this situation,\nwe call them structural graph coverage criteria. The other criteria are based on the\nflow of data through the software artifact represented by the graph and are called\ndata flow coverage criteria. Following the discussion in Chapter 1, we identify the\nappropriate test requirements and then define each criterion in terms of the test re-\nquirements. In general, for any graph-based coverage criterion, the idea is to identify\nthe test requirements in terms of various structures in the graph.\n\nFor graphs, coverage criteria define test requirements, TR, in terms of properties\nof test paths in a graph G. A typical test requirement is met by visiting a particular\nnode or edge or by touring a particular path. The definitions we have given so far for\na visit are adequate, but the notion of a tour requires more development. We return\nto the issue of touring later in this chapter and then refine it further in the context\n# \u301018\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\npath that is not a test path.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n44 Coverage Criteria\n\na<b\n\na=b\n\nn0 n1\n\nn3n2\n\na>b\n\nuse (n2 ) = { a, b }\n\ndef (n3) = { b }\n\ndef (n0 ) = { a,b }\n\nuse (n0 , n1 ) = { a, b }\n\nuse (n0 , n2 \n) = { a, b }\n\nuse (n0 , n3 ) = { a, b }\n\nFigure 2.11.

Design and implement a program that will compute all prime paths in a graph,\nthen derive test paths to tour the prime paths. Although the user interface can\nbe arbitrarily complicated, the simplest version will be to accept a graph as\ninput by reading a list of nodes, initial nodes, final nodes, and edges.\n\n2.2.2 Data Flow Criteria\n\nThe next few testing criteria are based on the assumption that to test a program\nadequately, we should focus on the flows of data values. Specifically, we should\ntry to ensure that the values created at one point in the program are created and\nused correctly. This is done by focusing on definitions and uses of values. A defini-\ntion (def) is a location where a value for a variable is stored into memory (assign-\nment, input, etc.). A use is a location where a variable\u2019s value is accessed. Data flow\ntesting criteria use the fact that values are carried from defs to uses. We call these\ndu-pairs (they are also known as definition-use, def-use, and du associations in the\ntesting literature). The idea of data flow criteria is to exercise du-pairs in various\nways.\n\nFirst we must integrate data flow into the existing graph model. Let V be a set of\nvariables that are associated with the program artifact being modeled in the graph.\nEach node n and edge e is considered to define a subset of V; this set is called def(n)\nor def(e). (Although graphs from programs cannot have defs on edges, other soft-\nware artifacts such as finite state machines can allow defs as side effects on edges.)\nEach node n and edge e is also considered to use a subset of V; this set is called\nuse(n) or use(e).\n\nFigure 2.11 gives an example of a graph annotated with defs and uses. All vari-\nables involved in a decision are assumed to be used on the associated edges, so a\nand b are in the use set of all three edges (n0, n1), (n0, n2), and (n0, n3).\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 45\n# \u301019\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFigure 2.25 illustrates the relationships that the data flow criteria will test. The\ncriteria require execution from definitions of actual parameters through calls to uses\nof formal parameters.\n\nThree types of data flow couplings have been identified. The most obvious is pa-\nrameter coupling, where parameters are passed in calls. Shared data coupling occurs\nwhen two units access the same data object as a global or other non-local variable,\nand external device coupling occurs when two units access the same external medium\nsuch as a file. In the following, all examples and discussion will be in terms of param-\neters and it will be understood that the concepts apply equally to shared data and\nexternal device coupling. We use the general term coupling variable for variables\nthat are defined in one unit and used in another.\n\nThis form of data flow is concerned only with last-defs before calls and returns\nand first-uses after calls and returns. That is, it is concerned only with defs and\nuses immediately surrounding the calls between methods. The last-defs before a\ncall are locations with defs that reach uses at callsites and the last-defs before a re-\nturn are locations with defs that reach a return statement. The following definitions\nassume a variable that is defined in either the caller or the callee, and used in the\nother.\n\nDefinition 2.40 Last-def: The set of nodes that define a variable x for which\nthere is a def-clear path from the node through the call site to a use in the\nother unit.\n\nThe variable can be passed as a parameter, a return value, or a shared variable\nreference. If the function has no return statement, an implicit return statement is\nassumed to exist at the last statement in the method.\n\nThe definition for first-use is complementary to that of last-def. It depends on\npaths that are not only def-clear, but also use-clear. A path from ni to nj is use-clear\nwith respect to variable v if for every node nk on the path, k \ufffd= i and k \ufffd= j , v is not\nin use(nk). Assume that the variable y is used in one of the units after having been\ndefined in the other. Assume that a variable y has received a value that has been\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 69\n\nF\n\nend B\n\nx = 14\nCaller\n\nCallee\n\nlast-def\n\nInterface\n\n...\n\n...\nprint (y)\n\ny = G (x)...\n\nG (a) print (a)...\nreturn (b)\n\nb = 42...\n\nfirst-use\n\ncallsite\n\nlast-def\n\nfirst-use\n\nDU pair\n\nDU pair\n\nFigure 2.26.

Note that\nthe assignment to y in F() is explicitly not the use, but considered to be part of the\ntransfer. Its use is further down, in the print(y) statement.\nVisible: 0% - 100%",

In general, for any graph-based coverage criterion, the idea is to identify\nthe test requirements in terms of various structures in the graph.\n\nFor graphs, coverage criteria define test requirements, TR, in terms of properties\nof test paths in a graph G. A typical test requirement is met by visiting a particular\nnode or edge or by touring a particular path. The definitions we have given so far for\na visit are adequate, but the notion of a tour requires more development. We return\nto the issue of touring later in this chapter and then refine it further in the context\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 33\n\nof data flow criteria. The following definition is a refinement of the definition of\ncoverage given in Chapter 1:\n\nDefinition 2.32 Graph Coverage: Given a set TR of test requirements for a\ngraph criterion C, a test set T satisfies C on graph G if and only if for every\ntest requirement tr in TR, there is at least one test path p in path(T) such\nthat p meets tr .\n\nThis is a very general statement that must be refined for individual cases.\n\n2.2.1 Structural Coverage Criteria\n\nWe specify graph coverage criteria by specifying a set of test requirements, TR. We\nwill start by defining criteria to visit every node and then every edge in a graph.\nThe first criterion is probably familiar and is based on the old notion of executing\nevery statement in a program. This concept has variously been called \u201cstatement\ncoverage,\u201d \u201cblock coverage,\u201d \u201cstate coverage,\u201d and \u201cnode coverage.\u201d We use the\ngeneral graph term \u201cnode coverage.\u201d Although this concept is familiar and simple,\nwe introduce some additional notation. The notation initially seems to complicate\nthe criterion, but ultimately has the effect of making subsequent criteria cleaner and\nmathematically precise, avoiding confusion with more complicated situations.\n\nThe requirements that are produced by a graph criterion are technically pred-\nicates that can have either the value true (the requirement has been met) or false\n(the requirement has not been met). For the double-diamond graph in Figure 2.3,\nthe test requirements for node coverage are: TR = { visit n0, visit n1, visit n2,\n",

Next the following\ninstrument is inserted onto each edge i: \u201cedgeCover[i]++;.\u201d\n\nThis process is illustrated in Figure 8.3.

As with node coverage, each node is\nassigned a unique number, but two arrays are used. Since edges can also contain\nuses, each edge must also be assigned a unique number. The technique is to use one\narray to keep track of definitions and another to keep track of uses.\n\nAt each location where variable x is defined, the statement \u201cdefCover[x] = i;\u201d is\nadded, where i is the node number. This means that defCover[x] will store the last\nlocation where x was defined. The second array keeps track of uses. For a variable\nx, useCover[] stores uses on a node or edge. For each node or edge i where a variable\nx is used, the statement \u201cuseCover[i, x, defCover[x]]++;\u201d is added. The array loca-\ntion useCover[i, x, defCover[x]] indicates that x is used at node (or edge) i and the\ndefinition from node defCover[x] has reached the use at i.\n\nFigure 8.4 illustrates instrumentation for All-uses.

This type of testing is used to verify that\nthe system is not changed by certain inputs. Shortly we will formalize this notion as\nround trip coverage.\n\nBefore defining round trip coverage, we need a few more definitions. A path\nfrom ni to nj is simple if no node appears more than once in the path, with the\nexception that the first and last nodes may be identical. That is, simple paths have\nno internal loops, although the entire path itself may wind up being a loop. One\nuseful aspect of simple paths is that any path can be created by composing simple\npaths.\n\nEven fairly small programs may have a very large number of simple paths. Most\nof these simple paths aren\u2019t worth addressing explicitly since they are subpaths of\nother simple paths. For a coverage criterion for simple paths we would like to avoid\nenumerating the entire set of simple paths. To this end we list only maximal length\nsimple paths. To clarify this notion, we introduce a formal definition for a maximal\nlength simple path, which we call a prime path, and we adopt the name \u201cprime\u201d for\nthe criterion:\n\nDefinition 2.35 Prime Path: A path from ni to nj is a prime path if it is a\nsimple path and it does not appear as a proper subpath of any other simple\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.4 Prime Path Coverage (PPC): TR contains each prime path in G.\n\nWhile this definition of prime path coverage has the practical advantage of keep-\ning the number of test requirements down, it suffers from the problem that a given\ninfeasible prime path may well incorporate many feasible simple paths. The solution\nis direct: replace the infeasible prime path with relevant feasible subpaths. For the\npurposes of this textbook, we choose not to include this aspect of prime path cover-\nage formally in the definition, but we assume it in later theoretical characterizations\nof prime path coverage.\n\nPrime path coverage has two special cases that we include below for histor-\nical reasons. From a practical perspective, it is usually better simply to adopt\nprime path coverage. Both special cases involve treatment of loops with \u201cround\ntrips.\u201d\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n36 Coverage Criteria\n\nA round trip path is a prime path of nonzero length that starts and ends at the\nsame node.

Many possible algorithms can find test paths to tour the prime\npaths. Observation will suffice with a graph as simple as in Figure 2.10. For example,\nit can be seen that the four test paths [0, 1, 5, 6], [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6], [0, 4, 6],\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n42 Coverage Criteria\n\nand [0, 4, 4, 6] are enough.

The easiest thing\nto do is to tour the loop [1, 2, 3] only once, which omits the prime paths [2, 3, 1, 2]\nand [3, 1, 2, 3].\n\nWith more complicated graphs, a mechanical approach is needed. We recom-\nmend starting with the longest prime paths and extending them to the begin-\nning and end nodes in the graph. For our example, this results in the test path\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]. The test path [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] tours 3 prime paths 25, 27, and 32.\n\nThe next test path is constructed by extending one of the longest remaining\nprime paths; we will continue to work backward and choose 30. The resulting test\npath is [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6], which tours 2 prime paths, 28 and 30 (it also tours\npaths 25 and 27).\n\nThe next test path is constructed by using the prime path 26 [0, 1, 5, 6]. This test\npath tours only maximal prime path 26.\n\nContinuing in this fashion yields two more test paths, [0, 4, 6] for prime path 19,\nand [0, 4, 4, 6] for prime path 14.\n\nThe complete set of test paths is then:\n\n1) [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n2) [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n3) [0, 1, 5, 6]\n4) [0, 4, 6]\n5) [0, 4, 4, 6]\n\nThis can be used as is, or optimized if the tester desires a smaller test set. It\nis clear that test path 2 tours the prime paths toured by test path 1, so 1 can be\neliminated, leaving the four test paths identified informally earlier in this section.\nSimple algorithms can automate this process.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.2.1.\n\n1.

One type of round trip test coverage requires at least one round trip\npath to be taken for each node, and another requires all possible round trip paths.\n\nCriterion 2.5 Simple Round Trip Coverage (SRTC): TR contains at least one\nround-trip path for each reachable node in G that begins and ends a round-trip\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.6 Complete Round Trip Coverage (CRTC): TR contains all round-\ntrip paths for each reachable node in G.\n\nNext we turn to path coverage, which is traditional in the testing literature.\n\nCriterion 2.7 Complete Path Coverage (CPC): TR contains all paths in G.\n\nSadly, complete path coverage is useless if a graph has a cycle, since this results\nin an infinite number of paths, and hence an infinite number of test requirements.\nA variant of this criterion is, however, useful. Suppose that instead of requiring all\npaths, we consider a specified set of paths. For example, these paths might be given\nby a customer in the form of usage scenarios.\n\nCriterion 2.8 Specified Path Coverage (SPC): TR contains a set S of test paths,\nwhere S is supplied as a parameter.\n\nComplete path coverage is not feasible for graphs with cycles; hence the reason\nfor developing the other alternatives listed above. Figure 2.7 contrasts prime path\ncoverage with complete path coverage. Part (a) of the figure shows the \u201cdiamond\u201d\ngraph, which contains no loops. Both complete path coverage and prime path cov-\nerage can be satisfied on this graph with the two paths shown. Part (b), however,\nincludes a loop from n1 to n3 to n4 to n1, thus the graph has an infinite number of\npossible test paths, and complete path coverage is not possible. The requirements\nfor prime path coverage, however, can be toured with two test paths, for example,\n[n0, n1, n2] and [n0, n1, n3, n4, n1, n3, n4, n1, n2].\n\nTouring, Sidetrips, and Detours\nAn important but subtle point to note is that while simple paths do not have internal\nloops, we do not require the test paths that tour a simple path to have this property.\nThat is, we distinguish between the path that specifies a test requirement and the\nportion of the test path that meets the requirement. The advantage of separating\nthese two notions has to do with the issue of infeasible test requirements. Before\ndescribing this advantage, let us refine the notion of a tour.\n",

An instru-\nment is additional program code that does not change the functional behavior of\nthe program but collects some additional information. The instrument can affect\nthe timing in a real-time system, and could also affect concurrency. Thus, such ap-\nplications require special attention. Careful design can make instrumentation very\nefficient.\n\nFor test criteria coverage, the additional information is whether individual test\nrequirements have been met. An initial example of instrumentation is shown in\nFigure 8.1. It illustrates a statement that is added to record if the body of an \u201cif-\nblock\u201d has been reached.\n\n8.1.1 Node and Edge Coverage\n\nOne of the simplest criteria to instrument for is node coverage. This method most\nobviously works with node coverage on program source, but the general idea works\nwith arbitrary graphs.

Next,\nthe following instrument is inserted at each node i: \u201cnodeCover [i]++;.\u201d\n\nIt is important that the nodeCover[] array be \u201cpersistent,\u201d that is, it must be saved\nto disk after each test case. This allows results to be accumulated across multiple\ntest cases. After some tests have been executed, every node i for which nodeCover[i]\nis zero has not been covered. If nodeCover[i] is not zero, its value represents the\nnumber of times node i was reached.\n\nThis process is shown in Figure 8.2. The nodeCover[] array must be read before\nexecution starts and is shown on node 1 in the figure.

Clearly, this idea can be extended to paths of any length, although\npossibly with diminishing returns. We formally define one of these criteria; others\nare left as exercises for the interested reader.\n\nCriterion 2.3 Edge-Pair Coverage (EPC): TR contains each reachable path of\nlength up to 2, inclusive, in G.\n\nOne useful testing criterion is to start the software in some state (that is, a node\nin the finite state machine) and then follow transitions (that is, edges) so that the\nlast state is the same as the start state. This type of testing is used to verify that\nthe system is not changed by certain inputs. Shortly we will formalize this notion as\nround trip coverage.\n\nBefore defining round trip coverage, we need a few more definitions. A path\nfrom ni to nj is simple if no node appears more than once in the path, with the\nexception that the first and last nodes may be identical. That is, simple paths have\nno internal loops, although the entire path itself may wind up being a loop. One\nuseful aspect of simple paths is that any path can be created by composing simple\npaths.\n\nEven fairly small programs may have a very large number of simple paths. Most\nof these simple paths aren\u2019t worth addressing explicitly since they are subpaths of\nother simple paths. For a coverage criterion for simple paths we would like to avoid\nenumerating the entire set of simple paths. To this end we list only maximal length\nsimple paths. To clarify this notion, we introduce a formal definition for a maximal\nlength simple path, which we call a prime path, and we adopt the name \u201cprime\u201d for\nthe criterion:\n\nDefinition 2.35 Prime Path: A path from ni to nj is a prime path if it is a\nsimple path and it does not appear as a proper subpath of any other simple\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.4 Prime Path Coverage (PPC): TR contains each prime path in G.\n",

This notion\nis refined to a coupling du-path with respect to a coupling variable x. A coupling\ndu-path is a path from a last-def to a first-use.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.2 can now be applied to coupling graphs.\nAll-Defs coverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to at least\none first-use. In this context, all-defs is called All-Coupling-Def coverage. All-Uses\ncoverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to every first-use. In\nthis context, All-Uses is also called All-Coupling-Use coverage.\n\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used. The complete set of coupling\ndu-pairs for class Quadratic is\n",

As is usual\nin the testing literature, we divide these criteria into two types. The first are usually\nreferred to as control flow coverage criteria. Because we generalize this situation,\nwe call them structural graph coverage criteria. The other criteria are based on the\nflow of data through the software artifact represented by the graph and are called\ndata flow coverage criteria. Following the discussion in Chapter 1, we identify the\nappropriate test requirements and then define each criterion in terms of the test re-\nquirements. In general, for any graph-based coverage criterion, the idea is to identify\nthe test requirements in terms of various structures in the graph.\n\nFor graphs, coverage criteria define test requirements, TR, in terms of properties\nof test paths in a graph G. A typical test requirement is met by visiting a particular\nnode or edge or by touring a particular path. The definitions we have given so far for\na visit are adequate, but the notion of a tour requires more development. We return\nto the issue of touring later in this chapter and then refine it further in the context\n",

Although the user interface can\nbe arbitrarily complicated, the simplest version will be to accept a graph as\ninput by reading a list of nodes, initial nodes, final nodes, and edges.\n\n2.2.2 Data Flow Criteria\n\nThe next few testing criteria are based on the assumption that to test a program\nadequately, we should focus on the flows of data values. Specifically, we should\ntry to ensure that the values created at one point in the program are created and\nused correctly. This is done by focusing on definitions and uses of values. A defini-\ntion (def) is a location where a value for a variable is stored into memory (assign-\nment, input, etc.). A use is a location where a variable\u2019s value is accessed. Data flow\ntesting criteria use the fact that values are carried from defs to uses. We call these\ndu-pairs (they are also known as definition-use, def-use, and du associations in the\ntesting literature). The idea of data flow criteria is to exercise du-pairs in various\nways.\n\nFirst we must integrate data flow into the existing graph model. Let V be a set of\nvariables that are associated with the program artifact being modeled in the graph.\nEach node n and edge e is considered to define a subset of V; this set is called def(n)\nor def(e). (Although graphs from programs cannot have defs on edges, other soft-\nware artifacts such as finite state machines can allow defs as side effects on edges.)\nEach node n and edge e is also considered to use a subset of V; this set is called\nuse(n) or use(e).\n\nFigure 2.11 gives an example of a graph annotated with defs and uses. All vari-\nables involved in a decision are assumed to be used on the associated edges, so a\nand b are in the use set of all three edges (n0, n1), (n0, n2), and (n0, n3).\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 45\n",

The\ncriteria require execution from definitions of actual parameters through calls to uses\nof formal parameters.\n\nThree types of data flow couplings have been identified. The most obvious is pa-\nrameter coupling, where parameters are passed in calls. Shared data coupling occurs\nwhen two units access the same data object as a global or other non-local variable,\nand external device coupling occurs when two units access the same external medium\nsuch as a file. In the following, all examples and discussion will be in terms of param-\neters and it will be understood that the concepts apply equally to shared data and\nexternal device coupling. We use the general term coupling variable for variables\nthat are defined in one unit and used in another.\n\nThis form of data flow is concerned only with last-defs before calls and returns\nand first-uses after calls and returns. That is, it is concerned only with defs and\nuses immediately surrounding the calls between methods. The last-defs before a\ncall are locations with defs that reach uses at callsites and the last-defs before a re-\nturn are locations with defs that reach a return statement. The following definitions\nassume a variable that is defined in either the caller or the callee, and used in the\nother.\n\nDefinition 2.40 Last-def: The set of nodes that define a variable x for which\nthere is a def-clear path from the node through the call site to a use in the\nother unit.\n\nThe variable can be passed as a parameter, a return value, or a shared variable\nreference. If the function has no return statement, an implicit return statement is\nassumed to exist at the last statement in the method.\n\nThe definition for first-use is complementary to that of last-def. It depends on\npaths that are not only def-clear, but also use-clear. A path from ni to nj is use-clear\nwith respect to variable v if for every node nk on the path, k \ufffd= i and k \ufffd= j , v is not\nin use(nk).

As is usual\nin the testing literature, we divide these criteria into two types. The first are usually\nreferred to as control flow coverage criteria. Because we generalize this situation,\nwe call them structural graph coverage criteria. The other criteria are based on the\nflow of data through the software artifact represented by the graph and are called\ndata flow coverage criteria. Following the discussion in Chapter 1, we identify the\nappropriate test requirements and then define each criterion in terms of the test re-\nquirements. In general, for any graph-based coverage criterion, the idea is to identify\nthe test requirements in terms of various structures in the graph.\n\nFor graphs, coverage criteria define test requirements, TR, in terms of properties\nof test paths in a graph G. A typical test requirement is met by visiting a particular\nnode or edge or by touring a particular path. The definitions we have given so far for\na visit are adequate, but the notion of a tour requires more development. We return\nto the issue of touring later in this chapter and then refine it further in the context\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 33\n\nof data flow criteria. The following definition is a refinement of the definition of\ncoverage given in Chapter 1:\n\nDefinition 2.32 Graph Coverage: Given a set TR of test requirements for a\ngraph criterion C, a test set T satisfies C on graph G if and only if for every\ntest requirement tr in TR, there is at least one test path p in path(T) such\nthat p meets tr .\n\nThis is a very general statement that must be refined for individual cases.\n\n2.2.1 Structural Coverage Criteria\n\nWe specify graph coverage criteria by specifying a set of test requirements, TR. We\nwill start by defining criteria to visit every node and then every edge in a graph.\nThe first criterion is probably familiar and is based on the old notion of executing\nevery statement in a program. This concept has variously been called \u201cstatement\ncoverage,\u201d \u201cblock coverage,\u201d \u201cstate coverage,\u201d and \u201cnode coverage.\u201d We use the\ngeneral graph term \u201cnode coverage.\u201d Although this concept is familiar and simple,\nwe introduce some additional notation. The notation initially seems to complicate\nthe criterion, but ultimately has the effect of making subsequent criteria cleaner and\nmathematically precise, avoiding confusion with more complicated situations.\n\nThe requirements that are produced by a graph criterion are technically pred-\nicates that can have either the value true (the requirement has been met) or false\n(the requirement has not been met). For the double-diamond graph in Figure 2.3,\nthe test requirements for node coverage are: TR = { visit n0, visit n1, visit n2,\n# \u30102\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nInstrumenting for edge coverage is only slightly more complicated than for node\ncoverage. Each edge in the graph is assigned a unique identifier number. An array\nis created that is indexed by the edge numbers (edgeCover []). Next the following\ninstrument is inserted onto each edge i: \u201cedgeCover[i]++;.\u201d\n\nThis process is illustrated in Figure 8.3. As with node coverage, the edgeCover[]\narray must be read before execution starts. Each node in Figure 8.3 is anno-\ntated with \u201cec\u201d as an abbreviation for \u201cedgeCover.\u201d The instrumentation for some\nedges is sometimes omitted if coverage is implied by another. For example, in Fig-\nure 8.3, any test that causes edge 3 to be executed will also cause edge 5 to be\nexecuted.\n\nSome structures do not explicitly represent all edges. For example, the follow-\ning program source does not have a location for the instrumentation on the else\nedge:\n\nif (isPrime)\n{ // save it!\n\nprimes[numPrimes] = curPrime;\nnumPrimes++;\n\n}\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nBuilding Testing Tools 271\n\nTherefore the else clause must be explicitly added to instrument for branch cov-\nerage:\n\nif (isPrime)\n{ // save it!\n\nprimes[numPrimes] = curPrime;\nnumPrimes++;\n\n}\nelse\n\nedgeCover[5]++;\n\n8.1.2 Data Flow Coverage\n\nData flow coverage is somewhat more complicated than node and edge coverage.\nThe primary difference is that the criterion is based on two locations in the program:\none for the definition and one for the use. As with node coverage, each node is\nassigned a unique number, but two arrays are used. Since edges can also contain\nuses, each edge must also be assigned a unique number. The technique is to use one\narray to keep track of definitions and another to keep track of uses.\n\nAt each location where variable x is defined, the statement \u201cdefCover[x] = i;\u201d is\nadded, where i is the node number. This means that defCover[x] will store the last\nlocation where x was defined. The second array keeps track of uses. For a variable\nx, useCover[] stores uses on a node or edge. For each node or edge i where a variable\nx is used, the statement \u201cuseCover[i, x, defCover[x]]++;\u201d is added. The array loca-\ntion useCover[i, x, defCover[x]] indicates that x is used at node (or edge) i and the\ndefinition from node defCover[x] has reached the use at i.\n\nFigure 8.4 illustrates instrumentation for All-uses. Variables x and y are defined\n(through parameter passing or assignments) at node 1 and y is redefined at node\n2. Variable x is used at nodes 4 and 5 and y is used at node 6.

This type of testing is used to verify that\nthe system is not changed by certain inputs. Shortly we will formalize this notion as\nround trip coverage.\n\nBefore defining round trip coverage, we need a few more definitions. A path\nfrom ni to nj is simple if no node appears more than once in the path, with the\nexception that the first and last nodes may be identical. That is, simple paths have\nno internal loops, although the entire path itself may wind up being a loop. One\nuseful aspect of simple paths is that any path can be created by composing simple\npaths.\n\nEven fairly small programs may have a very large number of simple paths. Most\nof these simple paths aren\u2019t worth addressing explicitly since they are subpaths of\nother simple paths. For a coverage criterion for simple paths we would like to avoid\nenumerating the entire set of simple paths. To this end we list only maximal length\nsimple paths. To clarify this notion, we introduce a formal definition for a maximal\nlength simple path, which we call a prime path, and we adopt the name \u201cprime\u201d for\nthe criterion:\n\nDefinition 2.35 Prime Path: A path from ni to nj is a prime path if it is a\nsimple path and it does not appear as a proper subpath of any other simple\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.4 Prime Path Coverage (PPC): TR contains each prime path in G.\n\nWhile this definition of prime path coverage has the practical advantage of keep-\ning the number of test requirements down, it suffers from the problem that a given\ninfeasible prime path may well incorporate many feasible simple paths. The solution\nis direct: replace the infeasible prime path with relevant feasible subpaths. For the\npurposes of this textbook, we choose not to include this aspect of prime path cover-\nage formally in the definition, but we assume it in later theoretical characterizations\nof prime path coverage.\n\nPrime path coverage has two special cases that we include below for histor-\nical reasons. From a practical perspective, it is usually better simply to adopt\nprime path coverage. Both special cases involve treatment of loops with \u201cround\ntrips.\u201d\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n36 Coverage Criteria\n\nA round trip path is a prime path of nonzero length that starts and ends at the\nsame node. One type of round trip test coverage requires at least one round trip\npath to be taken for each node, and another requires all possible round trip paths.\n\nCriterion 2.5 Simple Round Trip Coverage (SRTC): TR contains at least one\nround-trip path for each reachable node in G that begins and ends a round-trip\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.6 Complete Round Trip Coverage (CRTC): TR contains all round-\ntrip paths for each reachable node in G.\n\nNext we turn to path coverage, which is traditional in the testing literature.\n\nCriterion 2.7 Complete Path Coverage (CPC): TR contains all paths in G.\n# \u30104\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThis process is guaranteed to terminate because the length of the longest pos-\nsible prime path is the number of nodes. Although graphs often have many simple\npaths (32 in this example, of which 8 are prime), they can usually be toured with\nfar fewer test paths. Many possible algorithms can find test paths to tour the prime\npaths. Observation will suffice with a graph as simple as in Figure 2.10. For example,\nit can be seen that the four test paths [0, 1, 5, 6], [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6], [0, 4, 6],\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n42 Coverage Criteria\n\nand [0, 4, 4, 6] are enough. This approach, however, is error-prone. The easiest thing\nto do is to tour the loop [1, 2, 3] only once, which omits the prime paths [2, 3, 1, 2]\nand [3, 1, 2, 3].\n\nWith more complicated graphs, a mechanical approach is needed. We recom-\nmend starting with the longest prime paths and extending them to the begin-\nning and end nodes in the graph. For our example, this results in the test path\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]. The test path [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] tours 3 prime paths 25, 27, and 32.\n\nThe next test path is constructed by extending one of the longest remaining\nprime paths; we will continue to work backward and choose 30. The resulting test\npath is [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6], which tours 2 prime paths, 28 and 30 (it also tours\npaths 25 and 27).\n\nThe next test path is constructed by using the prime path 26 [0, 1, 5, 6]. This test\npath tours only maximal prime path 26.\n\nContinuing in this fashion yields two more test paths, [0, 4, 6] for prime path 19,\nand [0, 4, 4, 6] for prime path 14.\n\nThe complete set of test paths is then:\n\n1) [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n2) [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6]\n3) [0, 1, 5, 6]\n4) [0, 4, 6]\n5) [0, 4, 4, 6]\n\nThis can be used as is, or optimized if the tester desires a smaller test set. It\nis clear that test path 2 tours the prime paths toured by test path 1, so 1 can be\neliminated, leaving the four test paths identified informally earlier in this section.\nSimple algorithms can automate this process.\n\nEXERCISES\nSection 2.2.1.\n\n1. Redefine edge coverage in the standard way (see the discussion for node cov-\nerage).\n\n2.

Figure 2.7 contrasts prime path\ncoverage with complete path coverage. Part (a) of the figure shows the \u201cdiamond\u201d\ngraph, which contains no loops. Both complete path coverage and prime path cov-\nerage can be satisfied on this graph with the two paths shown. Part (b), however,\nincludes a loop from n1 to n3 to n4 to n1, thus the graph has an infinite number of\npossible test paths, and complete path coverage is not possible. The requirements\nfor prime path coverage, however, can be toured with two test paths, for example,\n[n0, n1, n2] and [n0, n1, n3, n4, n1, n3, n4, n1, n2].\n\nTouring, Sidetrips, and Detours\nAn important but subtle point to note is that while simple paths do not have internal\nloops, we do not require the test paths that tour a simple path to have this property.\nThat is, we distinguish between the path that specifies a test requirement and the\nportion of the test path that meets the requirement. The advantage of separating\nthese two notions has to do with the issue of infeasible test requirements. Before\ndescribing this advantage, let us refine the notion of a tour.\n\nWe previously defined \u201cvisits\u201d and \u201ctours,\u201d and recall that using a path p to tour\na subpath [n1, n2, n3] means that the subpath is a subpath of p. This is a rather strict\ndefinition because each node and edge in the subpath must be visited exactly in the\norder that they appear in the subpath. We would like to relax this a bit to allow\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 37\n\n(a) Prime Path Coverage on a\nGraph with No Loops\n\n(b) Prime Path Coverage on a\nGraph with Loops\n\nPrime Paths = { [n0, n1, n3], [n0, n2, n3] }\n\npath (t1)  = [n0, n1, n3]\n\npath (t2)  = [n0, n2, n3]\n\nT1 = {t1, t2}\n\nT1 satisfies prime path coverage on the graph\n\nPrime Paths = { [n0, n1, n2],\n\n               [n0, n1, n3, n4], [n1, n3, n4, n1],\n\n               [n3, n4, n1, n3], [n4, n1, n3, n4],\n\n               [n3, n4, n1, n2] }\n\npath (t3)  = [n0, n1, n2]\n\npath (t4)  = [n0, n1, n3, n4, n1, n3, n4, n1, n2]\n\nT2 = {t3, t4}\n\nT2 satisfies prime path coverage on the graph\n\nn0\n\nn2n1\n\nn3\n\nn0\n\nn3\n\nn1\n\nn2\n\nn4\n\nFigure 2.7.

Figure 2.7 contrasts prime path\ncoverage with complete path coverage. Part (a) of the figure shows the \u201cdiamond\u201d\ngraph, which contains no loops. Both complete path coverage and prime path cov-\nerage can be satisfied on this graph with the two paths shown. Part (b), however,\nincludes a loop from n1 to n3 to n4 to n1, thus the graph has an infinite number of\npossible test paths, and complete path coverage is not possible. The requirements\nfor prime path coverage, however, can be toured with two test paths, for example,\n[n0, n1, n2] and [n0, n1, n3, n4, n1, n3, n4, n1, n2].\n\nTouring, Sidetrips, and Detours\nAn important but subtle point to note is that while simple paths do not have internal\nloops, we do not require the test paths that tour a simple path to have this property.\nThat is, we distinguish between the path that specifies a test requirement and the\nportion of the test path that meets the requirement. The advantage of separating\nthese two notions has to do with the issue of infeasible test requirements. Before\ndescribing this advantage, let us refine the notion of a tour.\n# \u30109\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n8.1 INSTRUMENTATION FOR GRAPH AND LOGICAL\nEXPRESSION CRITERIA\n\nThe primary mechanism used to measure coverage is instrumentation. An instru-\nment is additional program code that does not change the functional behavior of\nthe program but collects some additional information. The instrument can affect\nthe timing in a real-time system, and could also affect concurrency. Thus, such ap-\nplications require special attention. Careful design can make instrumentation very\nefficient.\n\nFor test criteria coverage, the additional information is whether individual test\nrequirements have been met. An initial example of instrumentation is shown in\nFigure 8.1. It illustrates a statement that is added to record if the body of an \u201cif-\nblock\u201d has been reached.\n\n8.1.1 Node and Edge Coverage\n\nOne of the simplest criteria to instrument for is node coverage. This method most\nobviously works with node coverage on program source, but the general idea works\nwith arbitrary graphs. Each node in the graph is assigned a unique identifier number.\n\n268\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nBuilding Testing Tools 269\n\nOriginal Function With Instrument\n\npublic int min (A, B) public int min (A, B)\n{ {\n\nint m = A; int m = A;\nif (A > B) if (A > B)\n{ {\n\nm = B; Mark: \u201cif body has been reached\u201d\n} m = B;\nreturn (m); }\n\n} return (m);\n}\n\nFigure 8.1 Initial example of instrumentation.\n\nAn array is created that is indexed by the node numbers (called nodeCover []). Next,\nthe following instrument is inserted at each node i: \u201cnodeCover [i]++;.\u201d\n\nIt is important that the nodeCover[] array be \u201cpersistent,\u201d that is, it must be saved\nto disk after each test case. This allows results to be accumulated across multiple\ntest cases. After some tests have been executed, every node i for which nodeCover[i]\nis zero has not been covered. If nodeCover[i] is not zero, its value represents the\nnumber of times node i was reached.\n\nThis process is shown in Figure 8.2. The nodeCover[] array must be read before\nexecution starts and is shown on node 1 in the figure. Each node is annotated with\nthe appropriate instrumentation (\u201cnc\u201d is used as an abbreviation for \u201cnodeCover\u201d).\nAn automated coverage analysis tool can insert the instruments at the beginning\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4 5\n\n3\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\nint nodeCover [ ] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}\n\nRead (nodeCover [ ]);\nnodeCover [1] ++;\n\nnc [3]++;\n\nnc [5]++;\n\nnc [9]++;\n\nnc [6]++;\n\nnc [10]++;\n\nnc [8]++;\n\nnc [7]++;nc [4]++;\n\nnc [2]++;\n\nFigure 8.2.

This\ntype of analysis is prohibitively expensive with current technologies and of question-\nable value. Finally, data flow testing has traditionally taken an abstract view of array\nreferences. Identifying and keeping track of individual array references is an unde-\ncidable problem in general and very expensive even in finite cases. So, most tools\nconsider a reference to one element of an array to be a reference to the entire array.\n\nInheritance and Polymorphism (Advanced topic)\nThe previous discussion covers the most commonly used form of data flow testing\nas applied beyond the method level. However, the flow of data along couplings be-\ntween callers and callees is only one type of a very complicated set of data definition\nand use pairs. Consider Figure 2.29, which shows the types of du-pairs discussed so\nfar. On the left is a method, A(), which contains a def and a use. (For this discussion\nwe will omit the variable and assume that all du-pairs refer to the same variable.)\nThe right illustrates that there are two types of inter-procedural du-pairs.\n\nFull inter-procedural data flow identifies all du-pairs between a caller (A()) and\na callee (B()). Coupling inter-procedural data flow is as described in Section 2.4.2;\nidentifying du-pairs between last-defs and first-uses.\n\nFigure 2.30 illustrates du-pairs in object-oriented software.

For ex-\nample, one requirement is that each path of length (up to) two be toured by some\ntest path. With this context, node coverage could be redefined to contain each path\nof length zero. Clearly, this idea can be extended to paths of any length, although\npossibly with diminishing returns. We formally define one of these criteria; others\nare left as exercises for the interested reader.\n\nCriterion 2.3 Edge-Pair Coverage (EPC): TR contains each reachable path of\nlength up to 2, inclusive, in G.\n\nOne useful testing criterion is to start the software in some state (that is, a node\nin the finite state machine) and then follow transitions (that is, edges) so that the\nlast state is the same as the start state. This type of testing is used to verify that\nthe system is not changed by certain inputs. Shortly we will formalize this notion as\nround trip coverage.\n\nBefore defining round trip coverage, we need a few more definitions. A path\nfrom ni to nj is simple if no node appears more than once in the path, with the\nexception that the first and last nodes may be identical. That is, simple paths have\nno internal loops, although the entire path itself may wind up being a loop. One\nuseful aspect of simple paths is that any path can be created by composing simple\npaths.\n\nEven fairly small programs may have a very large number of simple paths. Most\nof these simple paths aren\u2019t worth addressing explicitly since they are subpaths of\nother simple paths. For a coverage criterion for simple paths we would like to avoid\nenumerating the entire set of simple paths. To this end we list only maximal length\nsimple paths. To clarify this notion, we introduce a formal definition for a maximal\nlength simple path, which we call a prime path, and we adopt the name \u201cprime\u201d for\nthe criterion:\n\nDefinition 2.35 Prime Path: A path from ni to nj is a prime path if it is a\nsimple path and it does not appear as a proper subpath of any other simple\npath.\n\nCriterion 2.4 Prime Path Coverage (PPC): TR contains each prime path in G.\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n34 Coverage Criteria\n\npath (t1 ) = [ n0, n1, n2 ]\npath (t2 ) = [ n0,  n2 ]\n\nn0\n\nn1\n\nn2\n\n x < y \n\n x > y \n\nT1 = { t1 }\nT1 satisfies node coverage on the graph\n\n(a) Node Coverage\n\nT2 = { t1 , t2 }\nT2 satisfies edge coverage on the graph\n\n(b) Edge Coverage\n\nFigure 2.6.

Java Reflection could also\nbe used to insert instrumentation, although we know of no tool that uses this tech-\nnique.\n\nInstrumenting for edge coverage is only slightly more complicated than for node\ncoverage.

This notion\nis refined to a coupling du-path with respect to a coupling variable x. A coupling\ndu-path is a path from a last-def to a first-use.\n\nThe coverage criteria from Section 2.2.2 can now be applied to coupling graphs.\nAll-Defs coverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to at least\none first-use. In this context, all-defs is called All-Coupling-Def coverage. All-Uses\ncoverage requires that a path be executed from every last-def to every first-use. In\nthis context, All-Uses is also called All-Coupling-Use coverage.\n\nFinally, All-du-Paths coverage requires that we tour every simple path from ev-\nery last-def to every first-use. As before, the All-du-Paths criterion can be satis-\nfied by tours that include sidetrips. In this context, All-du-Paths is also called All-\nCoupling-du-Paths coverage.\n\nExample\nNow we will turn to an example to illustrate coupling data flow. Class Quadratic in\nFigure 2.28 computes the quadratic root of an equation, given three integer coeffi-\ncients. The call to Root() on line 34 in main passes in three parameters. Each of the\nvariables X, Y, and Z have three last-defs in the caller at lines 16, 17, 18, lines 23, 24,\nand 25, and lines 30, 31, and 32. They are mapped to formal parameters A, B, and C\nin Root(). All three variables have a first-use at line 47. The class variables Root1 and\nRoot2 are defined in the callee and used in the caller. Their last-defs are at lines 53\nand 54 and the first-use is at line 37.\n\nThe value of local variable Result is returned to the caller, with two possible\nlast-defs at lines 50 and 55 and first-use at line 35.\n\nThe coupling du-pairs can be listed using pairs of triples. Each triple gives a unit\nname, variable name, and a line number. The first triple in a pair says where the\nvariable is defined, and the second where it is used.

Thus we choose to introduce a simpler version of the definition that abstracts\nthe issue of predicates in the test requirements.\n\nCriterion 2.1 Node Coverage (NC): TR contains each reachable node in G.\n\nWith this definition, it is left as understood that the term \u201ccontains\u201d actually\nmeans \u201ccontains the predicate visitn.\u201d This simplification allows us to simplify the\nwriting of the test requirements for Figure 2.3 to only contain the nodes: TR = {n0,\nn1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6}. Test path p1 = [n0, n1, n3, n4, n6] meets the first, second,\nfourth, fifth, and seventh test requirements, and test path p2 = [n0, n2, n3, n5, n6]\nmeets the first, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh. Therefore, if a test set T contains\n{t1, t2}, where path(t1) = p1 and path(t2) = p2, then T satisfies node coverage on G.\n\nThe usual definition of node coverage omits the intermediate step of explicitly\nidentifying the test requirements, and is often stated as given below.

So is the next common criterion of edge coverage,\nusually implemented as branch coverage:\n\nCriterion 2.2 Edge Coverage (EC): TR contains each reachable path of length\nup to 1, inclusive, in G.\n# \u301017\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nExcept for nondeterministic structures, which we do not consider until Chap-\nter 7, each test case will tour exactly one test path in graph G. Figure 2.4 illustrates\nthe difference with respect to test case/test path mapping for deterministic vs. non-\ndeterministic software.\n\nFigure 2.5 illustrates a set of test cases and corresponding test paths on a SESE\ngraph with the final node n f = n2. Some edges are annotated with predicates that\ndescribe the conditions under which that edge is traversed. (This notion is formal-\nized later in this chapter.) So, in the example, if a is less than b, the only path is from\nn0 to n1 and then on to n3 and n2. This book describes all of the graph coverage crite-\nria in terms of relationships of test paths to the graph in question, but it is important\nto realize that testing is carried out with test cases, and that the test path is simply a\nmodel of the test case in the abstraction captured by the graph.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n32 Coverage Criteria\n\n \n\n  (a) Graph for testing the case with input integers\na, b and output (a+b)\n\n(b) Mapping between test cases and test paths\n\nS1\n\na<b\n\na=b\n\nn0\nn1\n\nn3n2\n\na>b\n\n[ Test path p2 : n0, n3, n2 ]\n\n[ Test path p3 : n0, n2 ]\n\nTest case t1 : (a=0, b=1)\nMap to\n\nTest case t2 : (a=1, b=1)\n\nTest case t3 : (a=2, b=1)\n\n[ Test path p1 : n0, n1, n3, n2 ]\n\nFigure 2.5.

In Figure 2.5, find test case inputs such that the corresponding test path visits\n\nedge (n1, n3).\n\n2.2 GRAPH COVERAGE CRITERIA\n\nThe structure in Section 2.1 is adequate to define coverage on graphs. As is usual\nin the testing literature, we divide these criteria into two types. The first are usually\nreferred to as control flow coverage criteria. Because we generalize this situation,\nwe call them structural graph coverage criteria. The other criteria are based on the\nflow of data through the software artifact represented by the graph and are called\ndata flow coverage criteria. Following the discussion in Chapter 1, we identify the\nappropriate test requirements and then define each criterion in terms of the test re-\nquirements. In general, for any graph-based coverage criterion, the idea is to identify\nthe test requirements in terms of various structures in the graph.\n\nFor graphs, coverage criteria define test requirements, TR, in terms of properties\nof test paths in a graph G. A typical test requirement is met by visiting a particular\nnode or edge or by touring a particular path. The definitions we have given so far for\na visit are adequate, but the notion of a tour requires more development. We return\nto the issue of touring later in this chapter and then refine it further in the context\n# \u301018\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\npath that is not a test path.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n44 Coverage Criteria\n\na<b\n\na=b\n\nn0 n1\n\nn3n2\n\na>b\n\nuse (n2 ) = { a, b }\n\ndef (n3) = { b }\n\ndef (n0 ) = { a,b }\n\nuse (n0 , n1 ) = { a, b }\n\nuse (n0 , n2 \n) = { a, b }\n\nuse (n0 , n3 ) = { a, b }\n\nFigure 2.11.

Design and implement a program that will compute all prime paths in a graph,\nthen derive test paths to tour the prime paths. Although the user interface can\nbe arbitrarily complicated, the simplest version will be to accept a graph as\ninput by reading a list of nodes, initial nodes, final nodes, and edges.\n\n2.2.2 Data Flow Criteria\n\nThe next few testing criteria are based on the assumption that to test a program\nadequately, we should focus on the flows of data values. Specifically, we should\ntry to ensure that the values created at one point in the program are created and\nused correctly. This is done by focusing on definitions and uses of values. A defini-\ntion (def) is a location where a value for a variable is stored into memory (assign-\nment, input, etc.). A use is a location where a variable\u2019s value is accessed. Data flow\ntesting criteria use the fact that values are carried from defs to uses. We call these\ndu-pairs (they are also known as definition-use, def-use, and du associations in the\ntesting literature). The idea of data flow criteria is to exercise du-pairs in various\nways.\n\nFirst we must integrate data flow into the existing graph model. Let V be a set of\nvariables that are associated with the program artifact being modeled in the graph.\nEach node n and edge e is considered to define a subset of V; this set is called def(n)\nor def(e). (Although graphs from programs cannot have defs on edges, other soft-\nware artifacts such as finite state machines can allow defs as side effects on edges.)\nEach node n and edge e is also considered to use a subset of V; this set is called\nuse(n) or use(e).\n\nFigure 2.11 gives an example of a graph annotated with defs and uses. All vari-\nables involved in a decision are assumed to be used on the associated edges, so a\nand b are in the use set of all three edges (n0, n1), (n0, n2), and (n0, n3).\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 45\n# \u301019\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nFigure 2.25 illustrates the relationships that the data flow criteria will test. The\ncriteria require execution from definitions of actual parameters through calls to uses\nof formal parameters.\n\nThree types of data flow couplings have been identified. The most obvious is pa-\nrameter coupling, where parameters are passed in calls. Shared data coupling occurs\nwhen two units access the same data object as a global or other non-local variable,\nand external device coupling occurs when two units access the same external medium\nsuch as a file. In the following, all examples and discussion will be in terms of param-\neters and it will be understood that the concepts apply equally to shared data and\nexternal device coupling. We use the general term coupling variable for variables\nthat are defined in one unit and used in another.\n\nThis form of data flow is concerned only with last-defs before calls and returns\nand first-uses after calls and returns. That is, it is concerned only with defs and\nuses immediately surrounding the calls between methods. The last-defs before a\ncall are locations with defs that reach uses at callsites and the last-defs before a re-\nturn are locations with defs that reach a return statement. The following definitions\nassume a variable that is defined in either the caller or the callee, and used in the\nother.\n\nDefinition 2.40 Last-def: The set of nodes that define a variable x for which\nthere is a def-clear path from the node through the call site to a use in the\nother unit.\n\nThe variable can be passed as a parameter, a return value, or a shared variable\nreference. If the function has no return statement, an implicit return statement is\nassumed to exist at the last statement in the method.\n\nThe definition for first-use is complementary to that of last-def. It depends on\npaths that are not only def-clear, but also use-clear. A path from ni to nj is use-clear\nwith respect to variable v if for every node nk on the path, k \ufffd= i and k \ufffd= j , v is not\nin use(nk). Assume that the variable y is used in one of the units after having been\ndefined in the other. Assume that a variable y has received a value that has been\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nGraph Coverage 69\n\nF\n\nend B\n\nx = 14\nCaller\n\nCallee\n\nlast-def\n\nInterface\n\n...\n\n...\nprint (y)\n\ny = G (x)...\n\nG (a) print (a)...\nreturn (b)\n\nb = 42...\n\nfirst-use\n\ncallsite\n\nlast-def\n\nfirst-use\n\nDU pair\n\nDU pair\n\nFigure 2.26.

The criteria presented previously can be viewed\nas defining ways to divide the input space according to the test requirements. The\nassumption is that any collection of values that satisfies the same test requirement\nwill be \u201cjust as good.\u201d Input space partitioning takes that view in a much more di-\nrect way. The input domain is defined in terms of the possible values that the input\nparameters can have. The input parameters can be method parameters and global\nvariables, objects representing current state, or user-level inputs to a program, de-\npending on what kind of software artifact is being analyzed. The input domain is\nthen partitioned into regions that are assumed to contain equally useful values from\na testing perspective, and values are selected from each region.\n\nThis way of testing has several advantages. It is fairly easy to get started be-\ncause it can be applied with no automation and very little training. The tester\ndoes not need to understand the implementation; everything is based on a descrip-\ntion of the inputs. It is also simple to \u201ctune\u201d the technique to get more or fewer\ntests.\n\nConsider an abstract partition q over some domain D. The partition q defines a\nset of equivalence classes, which we simply call blocks, Bq.1 The blocks are pairwise\ndisjoint, that is\n\nbi \u2229 bj = \u2205, i \ufffd= j ; bi , bj \u2208 Bq\n\nand together the blocks cover the domain D, that is\n\u22c3\n\nb\u2208Bq\n\nb = D\n\nThis is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The input domain D is partitioned into three\nblocks, b1, b2, and b3. The partition defines the values contained in each block and is\nusually designed from knowledge of what the software is supposed to do.\n\nThe idea in partition coverage is that any test in a block is as good as any other\nfor testing. Several partitions are sometimes considered together, which, if not done\ncarefully, leads to a combinatorial explosion of test cases.\n\n150\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 151\n\nInput Domain D\n\nb1\n\nb3\n\nb2\n\nFigure 4.1. Partitioning of input\ndomain D into three blocks.\n\nA common way to apply input space partitioning is to start by considering the\ndomain of each parameter separately, partitioning each domain\u2019s possible values\ninto blocks, and then combining the variables for each parameter. Sometimes the\nparameters are considered completely independently, and sometimes they are con-\nsidered in conjunction, usually by taking the semantics of the program into account.\nThis process is called input domain modeling and the next section gives more details.\n\nEach partition is usually based on some characteristic C of the program, the pro-\ngram\u2019s inputs, or the program\u2019s environment. Some possible characteristic examples\nare:\n\n\ufffd Input X is null\n\ufffd Order of file F (sorted, inverse sorted, arbitrary)\n\ufffd Min separation distance of two aircraft\n\nEach characteristic C allows the tester to define a partition. Formally, a partition\nmust satisfy two properties:\n\n1. The partition must cover the entire domain (completeness)\n2. The blocks must not overlap (disjoint)\n\nAs an example, consider the characteristic \u201corder of file F\u201d mentioned above.\nThis could be used to create the following (defective) partitioning:\n# \u30102\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nTools like UML use cases can be used to identify testable functions. Each use case\nis associated with a specific intended functionality of the system, so it is very likely\nthat the use case designers have useful characteristics in mind that are relevant to\ndeveloping test cases. For example, a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d use case for an ATM identifies\n\u201cwithdrawing cash\u201d as a testable function. Further, it suggests useful categories such\nas \u201cIs Card Valid?\u201d and \u201cRelation of Withdrawal Policy to Withdrawal Request.\u201d\n\nThe second step is to identify all of the parameters that can affect the behavior\nof a given testable function. This step isn\u2019t particularly creative, but it is important\nto carry it out completely. In the simple case of testing a stateless method, the pa-\nrameters are simply the formal parameters to the method. If the method has state,\nwhich is common in many object-oriented classes, then the state must be included\nas a parameter. For example, the insert(Comparable obj) method for a binary tree\nclass behaves differently depending on whether or not obj is already in the tree.\nHence, the current state of the tree needs to be explicitly identified as a parameter\nto the insert() method. In a slightly more complex example, a method find(String\nstr) that finds the location of str in a file depends, obviously, on the particular file\nbeing searched. Hence, the test engineer explicitly identifies the file as a parameter\nto the find() method. Together, all of the parameters form the input domain of the\nfunction under test.\n\nThe third step, and the key creative engineering step, is modeling the input do-\nmain articulated in the prior step. An input domain model (IDM) represents the\ninput space of the system under test in an abstract way.

This infrastructure uses\nseveral technologies to let web services function together. The extensible markup\nlanguage (XML) is used to transmit messages and data. The universal description,\ndiscovery and integration (UDDI) specification is used to maintain directories of\ninformation about web services. These directories record information about web\nservices, including location and requirements, in a format that other web services\nand applications can read. The web services description language (WSDL) is used to\ndescribe how to access web services and what operations they can perform. SOAP\nhelps software transmit and receive XML messages over the Internet.\n\nResearch into testing web services has just begun and so far has centered on the\nmessages. Inputs to web service components are XML messages that correspond\nto specific syntactic requirements. These requirements can be described in XML\nschemas, which provide a grammar-based description of the messages. Researchers\nare beginning to apply the syntax testing criteria in Chapter 5 to test web services.\n\n7.3 TESTING GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES\n\nGraphical user interfaces (GUIs) account for half or more of the amount of source\ncode in modern software systems. Yet there is very little help for testing this large\namount of software. GUI testing falls into two categories. Usability testing refers to\nassessing how usable the interface is, using principles from user interface design.\nWhile usability testing is extremely important, it is out of the scope of this book.\nFunctional testing refers to assessing whether the user interface works as intended.\n\nFunctional testing can be further broken down into four types. GUI system test-\ning refers to performing system testing through the GUI. The only difference in\nGUI system testing other types of testing is in how to automate the tests. Regression\ntesting refers to testing the UI after changes are made. The most common type of\nregression test tool is a capture-replay tool. Generally speaking, they capture some\nuser inputs, replay them through the UI after changes have been made, and re-\nport the differences. Dozens of capture-replay tools are available on the market,\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 261\n\nthe concept is fairly simple, so they is not discussed further in this chapter. Input\nvalidation testing tests how well the software recognizes and responds to invalid in-\nputs. The techniques used for input validation testing are not particularly affected\nby using a graphical user interface as opposed to other types of interface, thus this\ntopic is not discussed in this section. Finally, GUI testing refers to assessing how well\nthe GUI works. The tester asks questions such as \u201cDo all the UI controls work as\nintended?\u201d, \u201cDoes the software allow the user to navigate to all screens that the\nuser would expect?\u201d, and \u201cAre inappropriate navigations disallowed?\u201d.\n\n7.3.1 Testing GUIs\n\nOne fairly obvious technique for testing GUIs is to use some sort of finite state ma-\nchine model, then apply graph-based criteria from Chapter 2. Modeling a GUI as\na state machine is fairly straightforward, as they are naturally event-based systems.\nEvery user event (pushing a button, entering text, navigating to another screen)\ncauses a transition to a new state. A path is a sequence of edges through the tran-\nsitions, and represents one test case. An advantage of this approach is that the ex-\npected output is simply the final state that the test case input should arrive in. The\nproblem with this approach is the possibility of state explosion; even small GUIs\nwill have thousands of states and transitions.\n# \u30104\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe next section provides two different approaches to input domain modeling.\nThe interface-based approach develops characteristics directly from input parame-\nters to the program under test. The functionality-based approach develops charac-\nteristics from a functional or behavioral view of the program under test. The tester\nmust choose which approach to use. Once the IDM is developed, several coverage\ncriteria are available to decide which combinations of values to use to test the soft-\nware. These are discussed in Section 4.2.\n\n4.1.1 Interface-Based Input Domain Modeling\n\nThe interface-based approach considers each particular parameter in isolation. This\napproach is almost mechanical to follow, but the resulting tests are surprisingly\ngood.\n\nAn obvious strength of using the interface-based approach is that it is easy\nto identify characteristics. The fact that each characteristic limits itself to a sin-\ngle parameter also makes it easy to translate the abstract tests into executable test\ncases.\n\nA weakness of this approach is that not all the information available to the test\nengineer will be reflected in the interface domain model. This means that the IDM\nmay be incomplete and hence additional characteristics are needed.\n\nAnother weakness is that some parts of the functionality may depend on com-\nbinations of specific values of several interface parameters. In the interface-based\napproach each parameter is analyzed in isolation with the effect that important sub-\ncombinations may be missed.\n\nConsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. It has three integer parameters\nthat represent the lengths of three sides of a triangle. In an interface-based IDM,\nSide1 will have a number of characteristics, as will Side2 and Side3. Since the three\nvariables are all of the same type, the interface-based characteristics for each will\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n154 Coverage Criteria\n\nlikely be identical. For example, since Side1 is an integer, and zero is often a special\nvalue for integers, Relation of Side1 to zero is a reasonable interface-based charac-\nteristic.\n\n4.1.2 Functionality-Based Input Domain Modeling\n\nThe idea of the functionality-based approach is to identify characteristics that cor-\nrespond to the intended functionality of the system under test rather than using the\nactual interface. This allows the tester to incorporate some semantics or domain\nknowledge into the IDM.\n\nSome members of the community believe that a functionality-based approach\nyields better test cases than the interface-based approach because the input domain\nmodels include more semantic information. Transferring more semantic informa-\ntion from the specification to the IDM makes it more likely to generate expected\nresults for the test cases, an important goal.\n\nAnother important strength of the functionality-based approach is that the re-\nquirements are available before the software is implemented. This means that input\ndomain modeling and test case generation can start early in development.\n\nIn the functionality-based approach, identifying characteristics and values may\nbe far from trivial. If the system is large and complex, or the specifications are in-\nformal and incomplete, it can be very hard to design reasonable characteristics. The\nnext section gives practical suggestions for designing characteristics.\n\nThe functionality-based approach also makes it harder to generate tests. The\ncharacteristics of the IDM often do not map to single parameters of the software\ninterface. Translating the values into executable test cases is harder because con-\nstraints of a single IDM characteristic may affect multiple parameters in the inter-\nface.\n\nReturning to the TriTyp program from Chapter 3, a functionality-based approach\nwill recognize that instead of simply three integers, the input to the method is a\ntriangle.

Partitioning of input\ndomain D into three blocks.\n\nA common way to apply input space partitioning is to start by considering the\ndomain of each parameter separately, partitioning each domain\u2019s possible values\ninto blocks, and then combining the variables for each parameter. Sometimes the\nparameters are considered completely independently, and sometimes they are con-\nsidered in conjunction, usually by taking the semantics of the program into account.\nThis process is called input domain modeling and the next section gives more details.\n\nEach partition is usually based on some characteristic C of the program, the pro-\ngram\u2019s inputs, or the program\u2019s environment. Some possible characteristic examples\nare:\n\n\ufffd Input X is null\n\ufffd Order of file F (sorted, inverse sorted, arbitrary)\n\ufffd Min separation distance of two aircraft\n\nEach characteristic C allows the tester to define a partition. Formally, a partition\nmust satisfy two properties:\n\n1. The partition must cover the entire domain (completeness)\n2. The blocks must not overlap (disjoint)\n\nAs an example, consider the characteristic \u201corder of file F\u201d mentioned above.\nThis could be used to create the following (defective) partitioning:\n\n\ufffd Order of file F\n\u2013 b1 = Sorted in ascending order\n\u2013 b2 = Sorted in descending order\n\u2013 b3 = Arbitrary order\n\nHowever, this is not a valid partitioning. Specifically, if the file is of length 0 or 1,\nthen the file will belong in all three blocks. That is, the blocks are not disjoint. The\neasiest strategy to address this problem is to make sure that each characteristic ad-\ndresses only one property. The problem above is that the notions of being sorted\ninto ascending order and being sorted into descending order are lumped into the\nsame characteristic. Splitting into two characteristics, namely sorted ascending and\nsorted descending, solves the problem. The result is the following (valid) partition-\ning of two characteristics.\n\n\ufffd File F sorted ascending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n152 Coverage Criteria\n\n\ufffd File F sorted descending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\nWith these blocks, files of length 0 or 1 are in the True block for both characteristics.\nThe completeness and disjointness properties are formalized for pretty prag-\n\nmatic reasons, and not just to be mathematically fashionable.

These are collectively called partition testing and include equiva-\nlence partitioning [249], boundary value analysis [249], category partition [283], and\ndomain testing [29]. An extensive survey with examples was published by Grindal\net al. [143].\n\nThe derivation of partitions and values started with Balcer, Hasling, and Os-\ntrand\u2019s category partition method in 1988 [23, 283]. An alternate visualization is\nthat of classification trees introduced by Grochtman, Grimm, and Wegener in 1993\n[145, 146]. Classification trees organize the input space partitioning information into\na tree structure. The first level nodes are the parameters and environment vari-\nables (characteristics); they may be recursively broken into sub-categories. Blocks\nappear as leaves in the tree and combinations are chosen by selecting among the\nleaves.\n\nChen et al. empirically identified common mistakes that testers made during in-\nput parameter-modeling [64]. Many of the concepts on input domain modeling in\nthis chapter come from Grindal\u2019s PhD work [140, 142, 144]. Both Cohen et al. [84]\nand Yin et al. [363] suggest functionality oriented approaches to input parameter\nmodeling. Functionality-oriented input parameter modeling was also implicitly used\nby Grindal et al. [141]. Two other IDM-related methods are Classification Trees\n[145] and a UML activity diagram based method [65]. Beizer [29], Malaiya [222],\nand Chen et al. [64] also address the problem of characteristic selection.\n\nGrindal published an analytical/empirical comparison of different constraint-\nhandling mechanisms [144].\n\nStocks and Carrington [320] provided a formal notion of specification-based test-\ning that encompasses most approaches to input space partition testing.

Cohen et al. [84] indicated that valid and invalid parameter val-\nues should be treated differently with respect to coverage. Valid values lie within\nthe bounds of normal operation of the test object, and invalid values lie outside\nthe normal operating range. Invalid values often result in an error message and the\nexecution terminates. To avoid one invalid value masking another, Cohen et al. sug-\ngested that only one invalid value should be included in each test case.\n# \u30107\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n\ufffd File F sorted ascending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n152 Coverage Criteria\n\n\ufffd File F sorted descending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\nWith these blocks, files of length 0 or 1 are in the True block for both characteristics.\nThe completeness and disjointness properties are formalized for pretty prag-\n\nmatic reasons, and not just to be mathematically fashionable.

Further,\nformally objectionable \u201cpartitions\u201d cause unnecessary problems when generating\ntests, as discussed below. The rest of this chapter assumes that the partitions are\nboth complete and disjoint.\n\n4.1 INPUT DOMAIN MODELING\n\nThe first step in input domain modeling is identification of testable functions. Con-\nsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. TriTyp clearly has only one testable func-\ntion with three parameters. The situation is more complex for Java class APIs. Each\npublic method is typically a testable function that should be tested individually.\nHowever, the characteristics are often the same for several methods, so it helps to\ndevelop a common set of characteristics for the entire class and then develop spe-\ncific tests for each method. Finally, large systems are certainly amenable to the in-\nput space partition approach, and such systems often supply complex functionality.\nTools like UML use cases can be used to identify testable functions. Each use case\nis associated with a specific intended functionality of the system, so it is very likely\nthat the use case designers have useful characteristics in mind that are relevant to\ndeveloping test cases. For example, a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d use case for an ATM identifies\n\u201cwithdrawing cash\u201d as a testable function. Further, it suggests useful categories such\nas \u201cIs Card Valid?\u201d and \u201cRelation of Withdrawal Policy to Withdrawal Request.\u201d\n\nThe second step is to identify all of the parameters that can affect the behavior\nof a given testable function. This step isn\u2019t particularly creative, but it is important\nto carry it out completely. In the simple case of testing a stateless method, the pa-\nrameters are simply the formal parameters to the method. If the method has state,\nwhich is common in many object-oriented classes, then the state must be included\nas a parameter. For example, the insert(Comparable obj) method for a binary tree\nclass behaves differently depending on whether or not obj is already in the tree.\nHence, the current state of the tree needs to be explicitly identified as a parameter\nto the insert() method. In a slightly more complex example, a method find(String\nstr) that finds the location of str in a file depends, obviously, on the particular file\nbeing searched. Hence, the test engineer explicitly identifies the file as a parameter\nto the find() method. Together, all of the parameters form the input domain of the\nfunction under test.\n\nThe third step, and the key creative engineering step, is modeling the input do-\nmain articulated in the prior step. An input domain model (IDM) represents the\ninput space of the system under test in an abstract way. A test engineer describes\n# \u30108\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n(b) Does the partition \u201cType of s1\u201d satisfy the disjointness property?

This must be documented in the IDM. For example, Table 4.7 shows\nan example based on the previously described boolean findElement (list, element)\nmethod. An IDM with two parameters A, that has four partitions, and B, that has\nthree partitions, has been designed. Two of the partition combinations do not make\nsense and are thus invalid. In this example, these are represented as a list of invalid\npairs of parameter partitions. In the general case other representations can be used,\nfor example, a set of inequalities.\n\nConstraints are relations between blocks from different characteristics. Two\nkinds of constraints appear. One kind says that a block from one characteristic can-\nnot be combined with a block from another characteristic. The \u201cless than zero\u201d and\n\u201cscalene\u201d problem is an example of this kind of constraint. The other kind is the in-\nverse; a block from one characteristic must be combined with a specific block from\nanother characteristic. Although this sounds simple enough, identifying and satisfy-\ning the constraints when choosing values can be difficult.\n# \u30109\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nInput Space Partitioning 157\n\nTable 4.2.

If one value is chosen from each block, the\nresult is three tests. For example, we might choose Side 1 to have the value 7 in test\n1, 0 in test 2, and \u22123 in test 3. Of course, we also need values for Side 2 and Side\n3 of the triangle to complete the test case values. Notice that some of the blocks\nrepresent valid triangles and some represent invalid triangles. For example, no valid\ntriangle can have a side of negative length.\n\nIt is easy to refine this categorization to get more fine grained testing if the bud-\nget allows. For example, more blocks can be created by separating inputs with value\n1. This decision leads to a partitioning with four blocks, as shown in Table 4.2.\n\nNotice that if the value for Side 1 were floating point rather than integer, the\nsecond categorization would not yield valid partitions. None of the blocks would\ninclude values between 0 and 1 (noninclusive), so the blocks would not cover the\ndomain (not be complete). However, the domain D contains integers so the parti-\ntions are valid.\n\nWhile partitioning, it is often useful for the tester to identify candidate values for\neach block to be used in testing. The reason to identify values now is that choosing\nspecific values can help the test engineer think more concretely about the predicates\nthat describe each block. While these values may not prove sufficient when refining\ntest requirements to test cases, they do form a good starting point. Table 4.3 shows\nvalues that can satisfy the second partitioning.\n\nThe above partitioning is interface based and only uses syntactic information\nabout the program (it has three integer inputs). A functionality-based approach can\nuse the semantic information of the traditional geometric classification of triangles,\nas shown in Table 4.4.\n\nOf course, the tester has to know what makes a triangle scalene, equilateral,\nisosceles, and invalid to choose possible values (this may be simple middle school\ngeometry, but many of us have probably forgotten). An equilateral triangle is one in\nwhich all sides are the same length. An isosceles triangle is one in which at least two\nsides are the same length. A scalene triangle is any other valid triangle. This brings\nup a subtle problem, Table 4.4 does not form a valid partitioning. An equilateral tri-\nangle is also isosceles, thus we must first correct the partitions, as shown in Table 4.5.\n\nTable 4.3.

This allows the tester to incorporate some semantics or domain\nknowledge into the IDM.\n\nSome members of the community believe that a functionality-based approach\nyields better test cases than the interface-based approach because the input domain\nmodels include more semantic information. Transferring more semantic informa-\ntion from the specification to the IDM makes it more likely to generate expected\nresults for the test cases, an important goal.\n\nAnother important strength of the functionality-based approach is that the re-\nquirements are available before the software is implemented. This means that input\ndomain modeling and test case generation can start early in development.\n\nIn the functionality-based approach, identifying characteristics and values may\nbe far from trivial. If the system is large and complex, or the specifications are in-\nformal and incomplete, it can be very hard to design reasonable characteristics. The\nnext section gives practical suggestions for designing characteristics.\n\nThe functionality-based approach also makes it harder to generate tests. The\ncharacteristics of the IDM often do not map to single parameters of the software\ninterface. Translating the values into executable test cases is harder because con-\nstraints of a single IDM characteristic may affect multiple parameters in the inter-\nface.\n\nReturning to the TriTyp program from Chapter 3, a functionality-based approach\nwill recognize that instead of simply three integers, the input to the method is a\ntriangle. This leads to the characteristic of a triangle, which can be partitioned into\ndifferent types of triangles (as discussed below).\n\n4.1.3 Identifying Characteristics\n\nIdentifying characteristics in an interface-based approach is simple. There is\na mechanical translation from the parameters to characteristics. Developing a\nfunctionality-based IDM is more challenging.\n\nPreconditions are excellent sources for functionality-based characteristics. They\nmay be explicit or encoded in the software as exceptional behavior. Preconditions\nexplicitly separate defined (or normal) behavior from undefined (or exceptional)\nbehavior. For example, if a method choose() is supposed to select a value, it needs\na precondition that a value must be available to select. A characteristic may be\nwhether the value is available or not.\n\nPostconditions are also good sources for characteristics. In the case of TriTyp, the\ndifferent kinds of triangles are based on the postcondition of the method.\n\nThe test engineer should also look for other relationships between variables.\nThese may be explicit or implicit. For example, a curious test engineer given a\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 155\n\nmethod m() with two object parameters x and y might wonder what happens if x\nand y point to the same object (aliasing), or to logically equal objects.\n\nAnother possible idea is to check for missing factors, that is, factors that may\nimpact the execution but do not have an associated IDM parameter.\n\nIt is usually better to have many characteristics with few blocks than the reverse.\nIt is also true that characteristics with small numbers of blocks are more likely to\nsatisfy the disjointness and completeness properties.\n\nGenerally, it is preferable for the test engineer to use specifications or other\ndocumentation instead of program code to develop characteristics. The idea is\nthat the tester should apply input space partitioning by using domain knowledge\nabout the problem, not the implementation. However, in practice, the code may\nbe all that is available. Overall, the more semantic information the test engi-\nneer can incorporate into characteristics, the better the resulting test set is likely\nto be.\n# \u301011\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nBeizer\u2019s book [29] includes a chapter on DNF testing, including a variant of IC\ncoverage for f , but not f\u0304 , and an extensive development of Karnaugh maps. We\ndo not address criteria defined predicates expressed in conjunctive normal form\n(CNF). The reason is that every DNF coverage criteria has a dual in CNF. Kuhn\n[194] developed the first fault detection relations; this work was greatly expanded\nby Yu, Lau, and Chen, who developed much of the key material relating DNF cov-\nerage criteria to fault detecting ability. Two good papers to begin study of this\ntopic are by Chen and Lau [63], which develops a variety of coverage criteria, in-\ncluding CUTPNFP, and Lau and Yu [202], which is the source for the fault class\nhierarchy shown in Figure 3.6. In personal communications, Greg Williams and\nGary Kaminski provided the authors with valuable assistance in organizing and ex-\npanding the DNF fault detection material. Greg Williams also developed the coun-\nterexample to show that UTPC and the ACC criteria do not share a subsumption\nrelation.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 In practice, this \u201cthought\u201d turned out to be the collective effort of many researchers, who\npublished dozens of papers over a period of several decades.\n\n2 Old hands at testing may recognize and even be tired of the triangle example. It is used\nas a teaching tool for the same reasons it has staying power in the literature: it\u2019s a familiar\nproblem; the control structure is interesting enough to illustrate most issues; and it does\nnot use language features that make this analysis really hard, such as loops and indirect\nreferences. This version of TriTyp is a bit overly complicated, but that does help illustrate\nthe concepts.\n\n3 The notion of mutation operators developed in the Chapter 5 is closely related to the notion\nof fault classes presented here.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n4\n\nInput Space Partitioning\n\nIn a very fundamental way, all testing is about choosing elements from the input\nspace of the software being tested. The criteria presented previously can be viewed\nas defining ways to divide the input space according to the test requirements. The\nassumption is that any collection of values that satisfies the same test requirement\nwill be \u201cjust as good.\u201d Input space partitioning takes that view in a much more di-\nrect way. The input domain is defined in terms of the possible values that the input\nparameters can have. The input parameters can be method parameters and global\nvariables, objects representing current state, or user-level inputs to a program, de-\npending on what kind of software artifact is being analyzed. The input domain is\nthen partitioned into regions that are assumed to contain equally useful values from\na testing perspective, and values are selected from each region.\n\nThis way of testing has several advantages. It is fairly easy to get started be-\ncause it can be applied with no automation and very little training. The tester\ndoes not need to understand the implementation; everything is based on a descrip-\ntion of the inputs. It is also simple to \u201ctune\u201d the technique to get more or fewer\ntests.\n\nConsider an abstract partition q over some domain D. The partition q defines a\nset of equivalence classes, which we simply call blocks, Bq.1 The blocks are pairwise\ndisjoint, that is\n\nbi \u2229 bj = \u2205, i \ufffd= j ; bi , bj \u2208 Bq\n\nand together the blocks cover the domain D, that is\n\u22c3\n\nb\u2208Bq\n\nb = D\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nSpecial values can often be used. Consider a Java reference variable; null is typ-\nically a special case that needs to be treated differently from non null values. If the\nreference is to a container structure such as a Set or List, then whether the container\nis empty or not is often a useful characteristic.\n\nConsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. It has three integer parameters\nthat represent the lengths of three sides of a triangle. One common partitioning\nfor an integer variable considers the relation of the variable\u2019s value to some special\nvalue in the testable function\u2019s domain, such as zero.\n\nTable 4.1 shows a partitioning for the interface-based IDM for the TriTyp pro-\ngram.

Of course, we also need values for Side 2 and Side\n3 of the triangle to complete the test case values. Notice that some of the blocks\nrepresent valid triangles and some represent invalid triangles. For example, no valid\ntriangle can have a side of negative length.\n\nIt is easy to refine this categorization to get more fine grained testing if the bud-\nget allows. For example, more blocks can be created by separating inputs with value\n1. This decision leads to a partitioning with four blocks, as shown in Table 4.2.\n\nNotice that if the value for Side 1 were floating point rather than integer, the\nsecond categorization would not yield valid partitions. None of the blocks would\ninclude values between 0 and 1 (noninclusive), so the blocks would not cover the\ndomain (not be complete). However, the domain D contains integers so the parti-\ntions are valid.\n# \u301013\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nDynamic analysis techniques are the most promising way to address these\nproblems, however, these problems are why analysis-based techniques are mostly\nconsidered to apply to small structures such as program units.\n\nThe most recent automatic test data generation approach uses search techniques\nsuch as genetic algorithms. Search-based approaches have several advantages, in-\ncluding being easy to implement and being very flexible. They cannot use as much\ninformation as the analysis-based methods, and thus can get stuck on values that\nare hard to find. For example, if a search-based technique is used to achieve edge\ncoverage on a method-level control flow graph, a predicate such as x+y = z presents\ndifficulty for search-based techniques. This problem is compounded if several such\npredicates have to be satisfied to reach a portion of the method. For this reason,\nsearch-based techniques have so far achieved more success at the system level than\nthe unit level.\n\n9.4 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAn excellent, if slightly dated, place to start on software for safety critical systems\nis Leveson\u2019s book [207]. Butler and Finelli wrote a great article on the futility of\nassuring ultra high confidence levels in software via any means, including testing\n[59]. Heimdahl [155] presents a good state-of-the-art perspective on the challenges\nof safety in software intensive systems. McGraw [233] is a good current source for\nthe many issues to consider in building secure software. For a somewhat older treat-\nment, readers might wish to try Rubin [306]. Denning\u2019s book [103] is a classic, al-\nthough it is out of print and hence harder to obtain.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nChallenges in Testing Software 291\n\nCasting the testability problem in terms of controllability and observability\ncomes originally from hardware testing; Friedman [129] and Binder [34] adapted it\nto software testing. Voas [333] developed the three part sensitivity model described\nin this chapter. Applying the testability model in conduction with random testing\nyields an interesting verification argument [334].\n\nOther criteria that we chose to omit are cataloged in a recent book by Pezze and\nYoung [289]. Other references can be found in the research papers cited in previous\nchapters.\n\nA good start for how the Web changes the way software is viewed is a book by\nPowell [292]. Several authors have commented on the inadequacies of subsumption\nfor practical use [149, 340, 344]. We know of four papers that compared data flow\nwith mutation testing [125, 230, 267, 274]. Lots of other papers have appeared that\nempirically compared other test criteria [25, 49, 81, 123, 124, 135, 258, 302, 304, 311,\n327].\n# \u301014\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe above partitioning is interface based and only uses syntactic information\nabout the program (it has three integer inputs). A functionality-based approach can\nuse the semantic information of the traditional geometric classification of triangles,\nas shown in Table 4.4.\n\nOf course, the tester has to know what makes a triangle scalene, equilateral,\nisosceles, and invalid to choose possible values (this may be simple middle school\ngeometry, but many of us have probably forgotten). An equilateral triangle is one in\nwhich all sides are the same length. An isosceles triangle is one in which at least two\nsides are the same length. A scalene triangle is any other valid triangle. This brings\nup a subtle problem, Table 4.4 does not form a valid partitioning. An equilateral tri-\nangle is also isosceles, thus we must first correct the partitions, as shown in Table 4.5.\n\nTable 4.3. Possible values for blocks in\nthe second partitioning in Table 4.2\n\nParam b1 b2 b3 b4\n\nSide 1 2 1 0 \u22121\nSide 2 2 1 0 \u22121\nSide 3 2 1 0 \u22121\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n158 Coverage Criteria\n\nTable 4.4. Geometric partitioning of TriTyp\u2019s inputs (functionality-based)\n\nPartition b1 b2 b3 b4\n\nq1 = \u201cGeometric Classification\u201d scalene isosceles equilateral invalid\n\nNow values for Table 4.5 can be chosen as shown in Table 4.6. The triplets rep-\nresent the three sides of the triangle.\n\nA different approach to the equilateral/isosceles problem above is to break\nthe characteristic Geometric Partitioning into four separate characteristics, namely\nScalene, Isosceles, Equilateral, and Valid. The partition for each of these character-\nistics is boolean, and the fact that choosing Equilateral = true also means choosing\nIsosceles = true is then simply a constraint. Such an approach is highly recommended,\nand it invariably satisfies the disjointness and completeness properties.\n\n4.1.5 Using More than One Input Domain Model\n\nFor a complex program it might be better to have several small IDMs than one large.\nThis approach allows for a divide-and-conquer strategy when modeling character-\nistics and blocks. Another advantage with multiple IDMs for the same software is\nthat it allows varying levels of coverage.\n\nFor instance, one IDM may contain only valid values and another IDM may con-\ntain invalid values to focus on error handling. The valid value IDM may be covered\nusing a higher level of coverage. The invalid value IDM may use a lower level of\ncoverage.\n\nMultiple IDMs may be overlapping as long as the test cases generated make\nsense. However, overlapping IDMs are likely to have more constraints.\n\n4.1.6 Checking the Input Domain Model\n\nIt is important to check the input domain model. In terms of characteristics, the\ntest engineer should ask whether there is any information about how the function\nbehaves that is not incorporated in some characteristics. This is necessarily an infor-\nmal process.\n\nThe tester should also explicitly check each characteristic for the completeness\nand disjointness properties. The purpose of this check is to make sure that, for each\ncharacteristic, not only do the blocks cover the complete input space, but selecting\na particular block implies excluding all other blocks in that characteristic.\n\nIf multiple IDMs are used, completeness should be relative to the portion of the\ninput domain that is modeled in each IDM. When the tester is satisfied with the\n# \u301015\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 165\n\nTable 4.7.

This must be documented in the IDM. For example, Table 4.7 shows\nan example based on the previously described boolean findElement (list, element)\nmethod. An IDM with two parameters A, that has four partitions, and B, that has\nthree partitions, has been designed. Two of the partition combinations do not make\nsense and are thus invalid. In this example, these are represented as a list of invalid\npairs of parameter partitions. In the general case other representations can be used,\nfor example, a set of inequalities.\n\nConstraints are relations between blocks from different characteristics. Two\nkinds of constraints appear. One kind says that a block from one characteristic can-\nnot be combined with a block from another characteristic. The \u201cless than zero\u201d and\n\u201cscalene\u201d problem is an example of this kind of constraint. The other kind is the in-\nverse; a block from one characteristic must be combined with a specific block from\nanother characteristic. Although this sounds simple enough, identifying and satisfy-\ning the constraints when choosing values can be difficult.\n\nHow constraints are handled when values are selected depends on the coverage\ncriterion chosen, and the decision is usually made when values are chosen. For the\nACoC, PWC, and TWC criteria, the only reasonable option is to drop the infeasible\npairs from consideration. For example, if PWC requires a particular pair that is not\nfeasible, no amount of tinkering on the test engineer\u2019s part can make that require-\nment feasible. However, the situation is quite different for a criterion such as BCC.\nIf a particular variation (for example, \u201cless than zero\u201d for \u201cRelation of Side 1 to\nzero\u201d) conflicts with the base case (for example, \u201cscalene\u201d for \u201cGeometric Classi-\nfication\u201d), then the obvious thing to do is change the offending choice for the base\ncase so that the variation is feasible. In this case, \u201cGeometric Classification\u201d clearly\nneeds to change to \u201cinvalid.\u201d\n\nAs another example, consider sorting an array. The input to our sort routine will\nbe a variable length array of some arbitrary type. The output will have three parts:\n(1) a permutation of the input array, sorted in ascending order, (2) the largest value\n(max), and (3) the smallest value (min).

Many of the concepts on input domain modeling in\nthis chapter come from Grindal\u2019s PhD work [140, 142, 144]. Both Cohen et al. [84]\nand Yin et al. [363] suggest functionality oriented approaches to input parameter\nmodeling. Functionality-oriented input parameter modeling was also implicitly used\nby Grindal et al. [141]. Two other IDM-related methods are Classification Trees\n[145] and a UML activity diagram based method [65]. Beizer [29], Malaiya [222],\nand Chen et al. [64] also address the problem of characteristic selection.\n\nGrindal published an analytical/empirical comparison of different constraint-\nhandling mechanisms [144].\n\nStocks and Carrington [320] provided a formal notion of specification-based test-\ning that encompasses most approaches to input space partition testing.

Cohen et al. [84] indicated that valid and invalid parameter val-\nues should be treated differently with respect to coverage. Valid values lie within\nthe bounds of normal operation of the test object, and invalid values lie outside\nthe normal operating range. Invalid values often result in an error message and the\nexecution terminates. To avoid one invalid value masking another, Cohen et al. sug-\ngested that only one invalid value should be included in each test case.\n\nBurroughs et al. [58] and Cohen et al. [84, 85, 86] suggested the heuristic pair-\nwise coverage as part of the Automatic Efficient Test Generator (AETG). AETG\nalso includes a variation on the base choice combination criterion. In AETG\u2019s ver-\nsion, called \u201cdefault testing,\u201d the tester varies the values of one characteristic at a\ntime while the other characteristics contain some default value. The term \u201cdefault\ntesting\u201d was also used by Burr and Young [57], who described yet another varia-\ntion of the base choices. In their version, all characteristics except one contain the\ndefault value, and the remaining characteristics contain a maximum or a minimum\nvalue. This variant will not necessarily satisfy \u201ceach choice coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Constrained Array Test System (CATS) tool for generating test cases\nwas described by Sherwood [313] to satisfy pair-wise coverage. For programs with\ntwo or more characteristics, the in-parameter-order (IPO) combination strategy\n[205, 206, 322] generates a test suite that satisfies pair-wise coverage for the first\ntwo parameters (characteristic in our terminology). The test suite is then extended\nto satisfy pair-wise coverage for the first three parameters and continues for each\nadditional parameter until all parameters are included.\n# \u301018\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n4.1.4 Choosing Blocks and Values\n\nAfter choosing characteristics, the test engineer partitions the domains of the char-\nacteristics into sets of values called blocks. A key issue in any partition approach is\nhow partitions should be identified and how representative values should be selected\nfrom each block. This is another creative design step that allows the tester to tune\nthe test process. More blocks will result in more tests, requiring more resources but\npossibly finding more faults. Fewer blocks will result in fewer tests, saving resources\nbut possibly reducing test effectiveness. Several general strategies for identifying\nvalues are as follows:\n\n\ufffd Valid values: Include at least one group of valid values.\n\ufffd Sub-partition: A range of valid values can often be partitioned into sub-\n\npartitions, such that each sub-partition exercises a somewhat different part of\nthe functionality.\n\n\ufffd Boundaries: Values at or close to boundaries often cause problems.\n\ufffd Normal use: If the operational profile focuses heavily on \u201cnormal use,\u201d the fail-\n\nure rate depends on values that are not boundary conditions.\n\ufffd Invalid values: Include at least one group of invalid values.\n\ufffd Balance: From a cost perspective, it may be cheap or even free to add more\n\nblocks to characteristics that have fewer blocks. In Section 4.2, we will see that\nthe number of tests sometimes depends on the characteristic with the maximum\nnumber of blocks.\n\n\ufffd Missing partitions: Check that the union of all blocks of a characteristic com-\npletely covers the input space of that characteristic.\n\n\ufffd Overlapping partitions: Check that no value belongs to more than one block.\n\nSpecial values can often be used. Consider a Java reference variable; null is typ-\nically a special case that needs to be treated differently from non null values. If the\nreference is to a container structure such as a Set or List, then whether the container\nis empty or not is often a useful characteristic.\n\nConsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. It has three integer parameters\nthat represent the lengths of three sides of a triangle. One common partitioning\nfor an integer variable considers the relation of the variable\u2019s value to some special\nvalue in the testable function\u2019s domain, such as zero.\n\nTable 4.1 shows a partitioning for the interface-based IDM for the TriTyp pro-\ngram. It has three characteristics, q1, q2, and q3.\n\nThe first row in the table should be read as \u201cBlock q1.b1 is that Side 1 is greater\nthan zero,\u201d \u201cBlock q1.b2 is that Side 1 is equal to zero,\u201d and \u201cBlock q1.b3 is that Side\n1 is less than zero.\u201d\n\nTable 4.1.

The criteria presented previously can be viewed\nas defining ways to divide the input space according to the test requirements. The\nassumption is that any collection of values that satisfies the same test requirement\nwill be \u201cjust as good.\u201d Input space partitioning takes that view in a much more di-\nrect way. The input domain is defined in terms of the possible values that the input\nparameters can have. The input parameters can be method parameters and global\nvariables, objects representing current state, or user-level inputs to a program, de-\npending on what kind of software artifact is being analyzed. The input domain is\nthen partitioned into regions that are assumed to contain equally useful values from\na testing perspective, and values are selected from each region.\n\nThis way of testing has several advantages. It is fairly easy to get started be-\ncause it can be applied with no automation and very little training. The tester\ndoes not need to understand the implementation; everything is based on a descrip-\ntion of the inputs. It is also simple to \u201ctune\u201d the technique to get more or fewer\ntests.\n\nConsider an abstract partition q over some domain D. The partition q defines a\nset of equivalence classes, which we simply call blocks, Bq.1 The blocks are pairwise\ndisjoint, that is\n\nbi \u2229 bj = \u2205, i \ufffd= j ; bi , bj \u2208 Bq\n\nand together the blocks cover the domain D, that is\n\u22c3\n\nb\u2208Bq\n\nb = D\n\nThis is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The input domain D is partitioned into three\nblocks, b1, b2, and b3. The partition defines the values contained in each block and is\nusually designed from knowledge of what the software is supposed to do.\n\nThe idea in partition coverage is that any test in a block is as good as any other\nfor testing. Several partitions are sometimes considered together, which, if not done\ncarefully, leads to a combinatorial explosion of test cases.\n\n150\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 151\n\nInput Domain D\n\nb1\n\nb3\n\nb2\n\nFigure 4.1. Partitioning of input\ndomain D into three blocks.\n\nA common way to apply input space partitioning is to start by considering the\ndomain of each parameter separately, partitioning each domain\u2019s possible values\ninto blocks, and then combining the variables for each parameter. Sometimes the\nparameters are considered completely independently, and sometimes they are con-\nsidered in conjunction, usually by taking the semantics of the program into account.\nThis process is called input domain modeling and the next section gives more details.\n\nEach partition is usually based on some characteristic C of the program, the pro-\ngram\u2019s inputs, or the program\u2019s environment. Some possible characteristic examples\nare:\n\n\ufffd Input X is null\n\ufffd Order of file F (sorted, inverse sorted, arbitrary)\n\ufffd Min separation distance of two aircraft\n\nEach characteristic C allows the tester to define a partition. Formally, a partition\nmust satisfy two properties:\n\n1. The partition must cover the entire domain (completeness)\n2. The blocks must not overlap (disjoint)\n\nAs an example, consider the characteristic \u201corder of file F\u201d mentioned above.\nThis could be used to create the following (defective) partitioning:\n",

Each use case\nis associated with a specific intended functionality of the system, so it is very likely\nthat the use case designers have useful characteristics in mind that are relevant to\ndeveloping test cases. For example, a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d use case for an ATM identifies\n\u201cwithdrawing cash\u201d as a testable function. Further, it suggests useful categories such\nas \u201cIs Card Valid?\u201d and \u201cRelation of Withdrawal Policy to Withdrawal Request.\u201d\n\nThe second step is to identify all of the parameters that can affect the behavior\nof a given testable function. This step isn\u2019t particularly creative, but it is important\nto carry it out completely. In the simple case of testing a stateless method, the pa-\nrameters are simply the formal parameters to the method. If the method has state,\nwhich is common in many object-oriented classes, then the state must be included\nas a parameter. For example, the insert(Comparable obj) method for a binary tree\nclass behaves differently depending on whether or not obj is already in the tree.\nHence, the current state of the tree needs to be explicitly identified as a parameter\nto the insert() method. In a slightly more complex example, a method find(String\nstr) that finds the location of str in a file depends, obviously, on the particular file\nbeing searched. Hence, the test engineer explicitly identifies the file as a parameter\nto the find() method.

Yet there is very little help for testing this large\namount of software. GUI testing falls into two categories. Usability testing refers to\nassessing how usable the interface is, using principles from user interface design.\nWhile usability testing is extremely important, it is out of the scope of this book.\nFunctional testing refers to assessing whether the user interface works as intended.\n\nFunctional testing can be further broken down into four types. GUI system test-\ning refers to performing system testing through the GUI. The only difference in\nGUI system testing other types of testing is in how to automate the tests. Regression\ntesting refers to testing the UI after changes are made. The most common type of\nregression test tool is a capture-replay tool. Generally speaking, they capture some\nuser inputs, replay them through the UI after changes have been made, and re-\nport the differences. Dozens of capture-replay tools are available on the market,\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 261\n\nthe concept is fairly simple, so they is not discussed further in this chapter. Input\nvalidation testing tests how well the software recognizes and responds to invalid in-\nputs. The techniques used for input validation testing are not particularly affected\nby using a graphical user interface as opposed to other types of interface, thus this\ntopic is not discussed in this section. Finally, GUI testing refers to assessing how well\nthe GUI works. The tester asks questions such as \u201cDo all the UI controls work as\nintended?\u201d, \u201cDoes the software allow the user to navigate to all screens that the\nuser would expect?\u201d, and \u201cAre inappropriate navigations disallowed?\u201d.\n\n7.3.1 Testing GUIs\n\nOne fairly obvious technique for testing GUIs is to use some sort of finite state ma-\nchine model, then apply graph-based criteria from Chapter 2. Modeling a GUI as\na state machine is fairly straightforward, as they are naturally event-based systems.\nEvery user event (pushing a button, entering text, navigating to another screen)\ncauses a transition to a new state. A path is a sequence of edges through the tran-\nsitions, and represents one test case. An advantage of this approach is that the ex-\npected output is simply the final state that the test case input should arrive in. The\nproblem with this approach is the possibility of state explosion; even small GUIs\nwill have thousands of states and transitions.\n",

For example, since Side1 is an integer, and zero is often a special\nvalue for integers, Relation of Side1 to zero is a reasonable interface-based charac-\nteristic.\n\n4.1.2 Functionality-Based Input Domain Modeling\n\nThe idea of the functionality-based approach is to identify characteristics that cor-\nrespond to the intended functionality of the system under test rather than using the\nactual interface. This allows the tester to incorporate some semantics or domain\nknowledge into the IDM.\n\nSome members of the community believe that a functionality-based approach\nyields better test cases than the interface-based approach because the input domain\nmodels include more semantic information. Transferring more semantic informa-\ntion from the specification to the IDM makes it more likely to generate expected\nresults for the test cases, an important goal.\n\nAnother important strength of the functionality-based approach is that the re-\nquirements are available before the software is implemented. This means that input\ndomain modeling and test case generation can start early in development.\n\nIn the functionality-based approach, identifying characteristics and values may\nbe far from trivial. If the system is large and complex, or the specifications are in-\nformal and incomplete, it can be very hard to design reasonable characteristics. The\nnext section gives practical suggestions for designing characteristics.\n\nThe functionality-based approach also makes it harder to generate tests. The\ncharacteristics of the IDM often do not map to single parameters of the software\ninterface. Translating the values into executable test cases is harder because con-\nstraints of a single IDM characteristic may affect multiple parameters in the inter-\nface.\n\nReturning to the TriTyp program from Chapter 3, a functionality-based approach\nwill recognize that instead of simply three integers, the input to the method is a\ntriangle. This leads to the characteristic of a triangle, which can be partitioned into\ndifferent types of triangles (as discussed below).\n\n4.1.3 Identifying Characteristics\n",

The\neasiest strategy to address this problem is to make sure that each characteristic ad-\ndresses only one property. The problem above is that the notions of being sorted\ninto ascending order and being sorted into descending order are lumped into the\nsame characteristic.

Partitions that are\nnot complete or disjoint probably reflect a lack of clarity in the rationale for the par-\ntition. In particular, if a partition actually encodes two or three rationales, the parti-\ntion is likely to be quite messy, and it is also likely to violate either the completeness\nor the disjointness property (or both!).

These are collectively called partition testing and include equiva-\nlence partitioning [249], boundary value analysis [249], category partition [283], and\ndomain testing [29]. An extensive survey with examples was published by Grindal\net al. [143].\n\nThe derivation of partitions and values started with Balcer, Hasling, and Os-\ntrand\u2019s category partition method in 1988 [23, 283]. An alternate visualization is\nthat of classification trees introduced by Grochtman, Grimm, and Wegener in 1993\n[145, 146]. Classification trees organize the input space partitioning information into\na tree structure. The first level nodes are the parameters and environment vari-\nables (characteristics); they may be recursively broken into sub-categories. Blocks\nappear as leaves in the tree and combinations are chosen by selecting among the\nleaves.\n\nChen et al. empirically identified common mistakes that testers made during in-\nput parameter-modeling [64]. Many of the concepts on input domain modeling in\nthis chapter come from Grindal\u2019s PhD work [140, 142, 144]. Both Cohen et al. [84]\nand Yin et al. [363] suggest functionality oriented approaches to input parameter\nmodeling. Functionality-oriented input parameter modeling was also implicitly used\nby Grindal et al. [141]. Two other IDM-related methods are Classification Trees\n[145] and a UML activity diagram based method [65]. Beizer [29], Malaiya [222],\nand Chen et al. [64] also address the problem of characteristic selection.\n\nGrindal published an analytical/empirical comparison of different constraint-\nhandling mechanisms [144].\n\nStocks and Carrington [320] provided a formal notion of specification-based test-\ning that encompasses most approaches to input space partition testing.

Partitions that are\nnot complete or disjoint probably reflect a lack of clarity in the rationale for the par-\ntition. In particular, if a partition actually encodes two or three rationales, the parti-\ntion is likely to be quite messy, and it is also likely to violate either the completeness\nor the disjointness property (or both!). Identifying and correcting completeness or\ndisjointness errors typically results in esthetically more pleasing partitions. Further,\nformally objectionable \u201cpartitions\u201d cause unnecessary problems when generating\ntests, as discussed below. The rest of this chapter assumes that the partitions are\nboth complete and disjoint.\n\n4.1 INPUT DOMAIN MODELING\n\nThe first step in input domain modeling is identification of testable functions. Con-\nsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. TriTyp clearly has only one testable func-\ntion with three parameters. The situation is more complex for Java class APIs. Each\npublic method is typically a testable function that should be tested individually.\nHowever, the characteristics are often the same for several methods, so it helps to\ndevelop a common set of characteristics for the entire class and then develop spe-\ncific tests for each method. Finally, large systems are certainly amenable to the in-\nput space partition approach, and such systems often supply complex functionality.\nTools like UML use cases can be used to identify testable functions. Each use case\nis associated with a specific intended functionality of the system, so it is very likely\nthat the use case designers have useful characteristics in mind that are relevant to\ndeveloping test cases. For example, a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d use case for an ATM identifies\n\u201cwithdrawing cash\u201d as a testable function. Further, it suggests useful categories such\nas \u201cIs Card Valid?\u201d and \u201cRelation of Withdrawal Policy to Withdrawal Request.\u201d\n\nThe second step is to identify all of the parameters that can affect the behavior\nof a given testable function. This step isn\u2019t particularly creative, but it is important\nto carry it out completely. In the simple case of testing a stateless method, the pa-\nrameters are simply the formal parameters to the method. If the method has state,\nwhich is common in many object-oriented classes, then the state must be included\nas a parameter. For example, the insert(Comparable obj) method for a binary tree\nclass behaves differently depending on whether or not obj is already in the tree.\nHence, the current state of the tree needs to be explicitly identified as a parameter\nto the insert() method. In a slightly more complex example, a method find(String\nstr) that finds the location of str in a file depends, obviously, on the particular file\nbeing searched. Hence, the test engineer explicitly identifies the file as a parameter\nto the find() method. Together, all of the parameters form the input domain of the\nfunction under test.\n\nThe third step, and the key creative engineering step, is modeling the input do-\nmain articulated in the prior step. An input domain model (IDM) represents the\ninput space of the system under test in an abstract way. A test engineer describes\n",

This must be documented in the IDM. For example, Table 4.7 shows\nan example based on the previously described boolean findElement (list, element)\nmethod. An IDM with two parameters A, that has four partitions, and B, that has\nthree partitions, has been designed. Two of the partition combinations do not make\nsense and are thus invalid. In this example, these are represented as a list of invalid\npairs of parameter partitions. In the general case other representations can be used,\nfor example, a set of inequalities.\n\nConstraints are relations between blocks from different characteristics. Two\nkinds of constraints appear. One kind says that a block from one characteristic can-\nnot be combined with a block from another characteristic. The \u201cless than zero\u201d and\n\u201cscalene\u201d problem is an example of this kind of constraint. The other kind is the in-\nverse; a block from one characteristic must be combined with a specific block from\nanother characteristic. Although this sounds simple enough, identifying and satisfy-\ning the constraints when choosing values can be difficult.\n",

If one value is chosen from each block, the\nresult is three tests. For example, we might choose Side 1 to have the value 7 in test\n1, 0 in test 2, and \u22123 in test 3. Of course, we also need values for Side 2 and Side\n3 of the triangle to complete the test case values. Notice that some of the blocks\nrepresent valid triangles and some represent invalid triangles. For example, no valid\ntriangle can have a side of negative length.\n\nIt is easy to refine this categorization to get more fine grained testing if the bud-\nget allows. For example, more blocks can be created by separating inputs with value\n1. This decision leads to a partitioning with four blocks, as shown in Table 4.2.\n\nNotice that if the value for Side 1 were floating point rather than integer, the\nsecond categorization would not yield valid partitions. None of the blocks would\ninclude values between 0 and 1 (noninclusive), so the blocks would not cover the\ndomain (not be complete). However, the domain D contains integers so the parti-\ntions are valid.\n\nWhile partitioning, it is often useful for the tester to identify candidate values for\neach block to be used in testing. The reason to identify values now is that choosing\nspecific values can help the test engineer think more concretely about the predicates\nthat describe each block. While these values may not prove sufficient when refining\ntest requirements to test cases, they do form a good starting point. Table 4.3 shows\nvalues that can satisfy the second partitioning.\n\nThe above partitioning is interface based and only uses syntactic information\nabout the program (it has three integer inputs).

An equilateral triangle is one in\nwhich all sides are the same length. An isosceles triangle is one in which at least two\nsides are the same length. A scalene triangle is any other valid triangle. This brings\nup a subtle problem, Table 4.4 does not form a valid partitioning.

This allows the tester to incorporate some semantics or domain\nknowledge into the IDM.\n\nSome members of the community believe that a functionality-based approach\nyields better test cases than the interface-based approach because the input domain\nmodels include more semantic information. Transferring more semantic informa-\ntion from the specification to the IDM makes it more likely to generate expected\nresults for the test cases, an important goal.\n\nAnother important strength of the functionality-based approach is that the re-\nquirements are available before the software is implemented. This means that input\ndomain modeling and test case generation can start early in development.\n\nIn the functionality-based approach, identifying characteristics and values may\nbe far from trivial. If the system is large and complex, or the specifications are in-\nformal and incomplete, it can be very hard to design reasonable characteristics. The\nnext section gives practical suggestions for designing characteristics.\n\nThe functionality-based approach also makes it harder to generate tests. The\ncharacteristics of the IDM often do not map to single parameters of the software\ninterface. Translating the values into executable test cases is harder because con-\nstraints of a single IDM characteristic may affect multiple parameters in the inter-\nface.\n\nReturning to the TriTyp program from Chapter 3, a functionality-based approach\nwill recognize that instead of simply three integers, the input to the method is a\ntriangle. This leads to the characteristic of a triangle, which can be partitioned into\ndifferent types of triangles (as discussed below).\n\n4.1.3 Identifying Characteristics\n\nIdentifying characteristics in an interface-based approach is simple. There is\na mechanical translation from the parameters to characteristics. Developing a\nfunctionality-based IDM is more challenging.\n\nPreconditions are excellent sources for functionality-based characteristics. They\nmay be explicit or encoded in the software as exceptional behavior. Preconditions\nexplicitly separate defined (or normal) behavior from undefined (or exceptional)\nbehavior. For example, if a method choose() is supposed to select a value, it needs\na precondition that a value must be available to select. A characteristic may be\nwhether the value is available or not.\n\nPostconditions are also good sources for characteristics. In the case of TriTyp, the\ndifferent kinds of triangles are based on the postcondition of the method.\n\nThe test engineer should also look for other relationships between variables.\nThese may be explicit or implicit. For example, a curious test engineer given a\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 155\n\nmethod m() with two object parameters x and y might wonder what happens if x\nand y point to the same object (aliasing), or to logically equal objects.\n\nAnother possible idea is to check for missing factors, that is, factors that may\nimpact the execution but do not have an associated IDM parameter.\n\nIt is usually better to have many characteristics with few blocks than the reverse.\nIt is also true that characteristics with small numbers of blocks are more likely to\nsatisfy the disjointness and completeness properties.\n\nGenerally, it is preferable for the test engineer to use specifications or other\ndocumentation instead of program code to develop characteristics. The idea is\nthat the tester should apply input space partitioning by using domain knowledge\nabout the problem, not the implementation. However, in practice, the code may\nbe all that is available. Overall, the more semantic information the test engi-\nneer can incorporate into characteristics, the better the resulting test set is likely\nto be.\n",

The criteria presented previously can be viewed\nas defining ways to divide the input space according to the test requirements. The\nassumption is that any collection of values that satisfies the same test requirement\nwill be \u201cjust as good.\u201d Input space partitioning takes that view in a much more di-\nrect way. The input domain is defined in terms of the possible values that the input\nparameters can have. The input parameters can be method parameters and global\nvariables, objects representing current state, or user-level inputs to a program, de-\npending on what kind of software artifact is being analyzed. The input domain is\nthen partitioned into regions that are assumed to contain equally useful values from\na testing perspective, and values are selected from each region.\n\nThis way of testing has several advantages. It is fairly easy to get started be-\ncause it can be applied with no automation and very little training.

One common partitioning\nfor an integer variable considers the relation of the variable\u2019s value to some special\nvalue in the testable function\u2019s domain, such as zero.\n\nTable 4.1 shows a partitioning for the interface-based IDM for the TriTyp pro-\ngram. It has three characteristics, q1, q2, and q3.\n\nThe first row in the table should be read as \u201cBlock q1.b1 is that Side 1 is greater\nthan zero,\u201d \u201cBlock q1.b2 is that Side 1 is equal to zero,\u201d and \u201cBlock q1.b3 is that Side\n1 is less than zero.\u201d\n\nTable 4.1.

If one value is chosen from each block, the\nresult is three tests. For example, we might choose Side 1 to have the value 7 in test\n1, 0 in test 2, and \u22123 in test 3. Of course, we also need values for Side 2 and Side\n3 of the triangle to complete the test case values. Notice that some of the blocks\nrepresent valid triangles and some represent invalid triangles. For example, no valid\ntriangle can have a side of negative length.\n\nIt is easy to refine this categorization to get more fine grained testing if the bud-\nget allows. For example, more blocks can be created by separating inputs with value\n1. This decision leads to a partitioning with four blocks, as shown in Table 4.2.\n\nNotice that if the value for Side 1 were floating point rather than integer, the\nsecond categorization would not yield valid partitions. None of the blocks would\ninclude values between 0 and 1 (noninclusive), so the blocks would not cover the\ndomain (not be complete). However, the domain D contains integers so the parti-\ntions are valid.\n",

Applying the testability model in conduction with random testing\nyields an interesting verification argument [334].\n\nOther criteria that we chose to omit are cataloged in a recent book by Pezze and\nYoung [289].

Several authors have commented on the inadequacies of subsumption\nfor practical use [149, 340, 344]. We know of four papers that compared data flow\nwith mutation testing [125, 230, 267, 274].

A functionality-based approach can\nuse the semantic information of the traditional geometric classification of triangles,\nas shown in Table 4.4.\n\nOf course, the tester has to know what makes a triangle scalene, equilateral,\nisosceles, and invalid to choose possible values (this may be simple middle school\ngeometry, but many of us have probably forgotten). An equilateral triangle is one in\nwhich all sides are the same length. An isosceles triangle is one in which at least two\nsides are the same length. A scalene triangle is any other valid triangle. This brings\nup a subtle problem, Table 4.4 does not form a valid partitioning.

The triplets rep-\nresent the three sides of the triangle.\n\nA different approach to the equilateral/isosceles problem above is to break\nthe characteristic Geometric Partitioning into four separate characteristics, namely\nScalene, Isosceles, Equilateral, and Valid. The partition for each of these character-\nistics is boolean, and the fact that choosing Equilateral = true also means choosing\nIsosceles = true is then simply a constraint. Such an approach is highly recommended,\nand it invariably satisfies the disjointness and completeness properties.\n\n4.1.5 Using More than One Input Domain Model\n\nFor a complex program it might be better to have several small IDMs than one large.\nThis approach allows for a divide-and-conquer strategy when modeling character-\nistics and blocks. Another advantage with multiple IDMs for the same software is\nthat it allows varying levels of coverage.\n\nFor instance, one IDM may contain only valid values and another IDM may con-\ntain invalid values to focus on error handling. The valid value IDM may be covered\nusing a higher level of coverage. The invalid value IDM may use a lower level of\ncoverage.\n\nMultiple IDMs may be overlapping as long as the test cases generated make\nsense. However, overlapping IDMs are likely to have more constraints.\n\n4.1.6 Checking the Input Domain Model\n\nIt is important to check the input domain model. In terms of characteristics, the\ntest engineer should ask whether there is any information about how the function\nbehaves that is not incorporated in some characteristics. This is necessarily an infor-\nmal process.\n\nThe tester should also explicitly check each characteristic for the completeness\nand disjointness properties. The purpose of this check is to make sure that, for each\ncharacteristic, not only do the blocks cover the complete input space, but selecting\na particular block implies excluding all other blocks in that characteristic.\n\nIf multiple IDMs are used, completeness should be relative to the portion of the\ninput domain that is modeled in each IDM.

This must be documented in the IDM. For example, Table 4.7 shows\nan example based on the previously described boolean findElement (list, element)\nmethod. An IDM with two parameters A, that has four partitions, and B, that has\nthree partitions, has been designed. Two of the partition combinations do not make\nsense and are thus invalid. In this example, these are represented as a list of invalid\npairs of parameter partitions. In the general case other representations can be used,\nfor example, a set of inequalities.\n\nConstraints are relations between blocks from different characteristics. Two\nkinds of constraints appear. One kind says that a block from one characteristic can-\nnot be combined with a block from another characteristic. The \u201cless than zero\u201d and\n\u201cscalene\u201d problem is an example of this kind of constraint. The other kind is the in-\nverse; a block from one characteristic must be combined with a specific block from\nanother characteristic. Although this sounds simple enough, identifying and satisfy-\ning the constraints when choosing values can be difficult.\n\nHow constraints are handled when values are selected depends on the coverage\ncriterion chosen, and the decision is usually made when values are chosen. For the\nACoC, PWC, and TWC criteria, the only reasonable option is to drop the infeasible\npairs from consideration. For example, if PWC requires a particular pair that is not\nfeasible, no amount of tinkering on the test engineer\u2019s part can make that require-\nment feasible. However, the situation is quite different for a criterion such as BCC.\nIf a particular variation (for example, \u201cless than zero\u201d for \u201cRelation of Side 1 to\nzero\u201d) conflicts with the base case (for example, \u201cscalene\u201d for \u201cGeometric Classi-\nfication\u201d), then the obvious thing to do is change the offending choice for the base\ncase so that the variation is feasible. In this case, \u201cGeometric Classification\u201d clearly\nneeds to change to \u201cinvalid.\u201d\n\nAs another example, consider sorting an array. The input to our sort routine will\nbe a variable length array of some arbitrary type. The output will have three parts:\n(1) a permutation of the input array, sorted in ascending order, (2) the largest value\n(max), and (3) the smallest value (min).

Cohen et al. [84] indicated that valid and invalid parameter val-\nues should be treated differently with respect to coverage. Valid values lie within\nthe bounds of normal operation of the test object, and invalid values lie outside\nthe normal operating range. Invalid values often result in an error message and the\nexecution terminates. To avoid one invalid value masking another, Cohen et al. sug-\ngested that only one invalid value should be included in each test case.\n\nBurroughs et al. [58] and Cohen et al. [84, 85, 86] suggested the heuristic pair-\nwise coverage as part of the Automatic Efficient Test Generator (AETG). AETG\nalso includes a variation on the base choice combination criterion. In AETG\u2019s ver-\nsion, called \u201cdefault testing,\u201d the tester varies the values of one characteristic at a\ntime while the other characteristics contain some default value. The term \u201cdefault\ntesting\u201d was also used by Burr and Young [57], who described yet another varia-\ntion of the base choices. In their version, all characteristics except one contain the\ndefault value, and the remaining characteristics contain a maximum or a minimum\nvalue. This variant will not necessarily satisfy \u201ceach choice coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Constrained Array Test System (CATS) tool for generating test cases\nwas described by Sherwood [313] to satisfy pair-wise coverage. For programs with\ntwo or more characteristics, the in-parameter-order (IPO) combination strategy\n[205, 206, 322] generates a test suite that satisfies pair-wise coverage for the first\ntwo parameters (characteristic in our terminology). The test suite is then extended\nto satisfy pair-wise coverage for the first three parameters and continues for each\nadditional parameter until all parameters are included.\n",

A key issue in any partition approach is\nhow partitions should be identified and how representative values should be selected\nfrom each block. This is another creative design step that allows the tester to tune\nthe test process. More blocks will result in more tests, requiring more resources but\npossibly finding more faults. Fewer blocks will result in fewer tests, saving resources\nbut possibly reducing test effectiveness. Several general strategies for identifying\nvalues are as follows:\n\n\ufffd Valid values: Include at least one group of valid values.\n\ufffd Sub-partition: A range of valid values can often be partitioned into sub-\n\npartitions, such that each sub-partition exercises a somewhat different part of\nthe functionality.\n\n\ufffd Boundaries: Values at or close to boundaries often cause problems.\n\ufffd Normal use: If the operational profile focuses heavily on \u201cnormal use,\u201d the fail-\n\nure rate depends on values that are not boundary conditions.\n\ufffd Invalid values: Include at least one group of invalid values.\n\ufffd Balance: From a cost perspective, it may be cheap or even free to add more\n\nblocks to characteristics that have fewer blocks. In Section 4.2, we will see that\nthe number of tests sometimes depends on the characteristic with the maximum\nnumber of blocks.\n\n\ufffd Missing partitions: Check that the union of all blocks of a characteristic com-\npletely covers the input space of that characteristic.\n\n\ufffd Overlapping partitions: Check that no value belongs to more than one block.\n\nSpecial values can often be used. Consider a Java reference variable; null is typ-\nically a special case that needs to be treated differently from non null values. If the\nreference is to a container structure such as a Set or List, then whether the container\nis empty or not is often a useful characteristic.\n\nConsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. It has three integer parameters\nthat represent the lengths of three sides of a triangle.

Another advantage with multiple IDMs for the same software is\nthat it allows varying levels of coverage.\n\nFor instance, one IDM may contain only valid values and another IDM may con-\ntain invalid values to focus on error handling. The valid value IDM may be covered\nusing a higher level of coverage. The invalid value IDM may use a lower level of\ncoverage.\n\nMultiple IDMs may be overlapping as long as the test cases generated make\nsense. However, overlapping IDMs are likely to have more constraints.\n\n4.1.6 Checking the Input Domain Model\n\nIt is important to check the input domain model.

The criteria presented previously can be viewed\nas defining ways to divide the input space according to the test requirements. The\nassumption is that any collection of values that satisfies the same test requirement\nwill be \u201cjust as good.\u201d Input space partitioning takes that view in a much more di-\nrect way. The input domain is defined in terms of the possible values that the input\nparameters can have. The input parameters can be method parameters and global\nvariables, objects representing current state, or user-level inputs to a program, de-\npending on what kind of software artifact is being analyzed. The input domain is\nthen partitioned into regions that are assumed to contain equally useful values from\na testing perspective, and values are selected from each region.\n\nThis way of testing has several advantages. It is fairly easy to get started be-\ncause it can be applied with no automation and very little training. The tester\ndoes not need to understand the implementation; everything is based on a descrip-\ntion of the inputs. It is also simple to \u201ctune\u201d the technique to get more or fewer\ntests.\n\nConsider an abstract partition q over some domain D. The partition q defines a\nset of equivalence classes, which we simply call blocks, Bq.1 The blocks are pairwise\ndisjoint, that is\n\nbi \u2229 bj = \u2205, i \ufffd= j ; bi , bj \u2208 Bq\n\nand together the blocks cover the domain D, that is\n\u22c3\n\nb\u2208Bq\n\nb = D\n\nThis is illustrated in Figure 4.1. The input domain D is partitioned into three\nblocks, b1, b2, and b3. The partition defines the values contained in each block and is\nusually designed from knowledge of what the software is supposed to do.\n\nThe idea in partition coverage is that any test in a block is as good as any other\nfor testing. Several partitions are sometimes considered together, which, if not done\ncarefully, leads to a combinatorial explosion of test cases.\n\n150\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 151\n\nInput Domain D\n\nb1\n\nb3\n\nb2\n\nFigure 4.1. Partitioning of input\ndomain D into three blocks.\n\nA common way to apply input space partitioning is to start by considering the\ndomain of each parameter separately, partitioning each domain\u2019s possible values\ninto blocks, and then combining the variables for each parameter. Sometimes the\nparameters are considered completely independently, and sometimes they are con-\nsidered in conjunction, usually by taking the semantics of the program into account.\nThis process is called input domain modeling and the next section gives more details.\n\nEach partition is usually based on some characteristic C of the program, the pro-\ngram\u2019s inputs, or the program\u2019s environment. Some possible characteristic examples\nare:\n\n\ufffd Input X is null\n\ufffd Order of file F (sorted, inverse sorted, arbitrary)\n\ufffd Min separation distance of two aircraft\n\nEach characteristic C allows the tester to define a partition. Formally, a partition\nmust satisfy two properties:\n\n1. The partition must cover the entire domain (completeness)\n2. The blocks must not overlap (disjoint)\n\nAs an example, consider the characteristic \u201corder of file F\u201d mentioned above.\nThis could be used to create the following (defective) partitioning:\n# \u30102\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nTools like UML use cases can be used to identify testable functions. Each use case\nis associated with a specific intended functionality of the system, so it is very likely\nthat the use case designers have useful characteristics in mind that are relevant to\ndeveloping test cases. For example, a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d use case for an ATM identifies\n\u201cwithdrawing cash\u201d as a testable function. Further, it suggests useful categories such\nas \u201cIs Card Valid?\u201d and \u201cRelation of Withdrawal Policy to Withdrawal Request.\u201d\n\nThe second step is to identify all of the parameters that can affect the behavior\nof a given testable function. This step isn\u2019t particularly creative, but it is important\nto carry it out completely. In the simple case of testing a stateless method, the pa-\nrameters are simply the formal parameters to the method. If the method has state,\nwhich is common in many object-oriented classes, then the state must be included\nas a parameter. For example, the insert(Comparable obj) method for a binary tree\nclass behaves differently depending on whether or not obj is already in the tree.\nHence, the current state of the tree needs to be explicitly identified as a parameter\nto the insert() method. In a slightly more complex example, a method find(String\nstr) that finds the location of str in a file depends, obviously, on the particular file\nbeing searched. Hence, the test engineer explicitly identifies the file as a parameter\nto the find() method. Together, all of the parameters form the input domain of the\nfunction under test.\n\nThe third step, and the key creative engineering step, is modeling the input do-\nmain articulated in the prior step. An input domain model (IDM) represents the\ninput space of the system under test in an abstract way.

This infrastructure uses\nseveral technologies to let web services function together. The extensible markup\nlanguage (XML) is used to transmit messages and data. The universal description,\ndiscovery and integration (UDDI) specification is used to maintain directories of\ninformation about web services. These directories record information about web\nservices, including location and requirements, in a format that other web services\nand applications can read. The web services description language (WSDL) is used to\ndescribe how to access web services and what operations they can perform. SOAP\nhelps software transmit and receive XML messages over the Internet.\n\nResearch into testing web services has just begun and so far has centered on the\nmessages. Inputs to web service components are XML messages that correspond\nto specific syntactic requirements. These requirements can be described in XML\nschemas, which provide a grammar-based description of the messages. Researchers\nare beginning to apply the syntax testing criteria in Chapter 5 to test web services.\n\n7.3 TESTING GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES\n\nGraphical user interfaces (GUIs) account for half or more of the amount of source\ncode in modern software systems. Yet there is very little help for testing this large\namount of software. GUI testing falls into two categories. Usability testing refers to\nassessing how usable the interface is, using principles from user interface design.\nWhile usability testing is extremely important, it is out of the scope of this book.\nFunctional testing refers to assessing whether the user interface works as intended.\n\nFunctional testing can be further broken down into four types. GUI system test-\ning refers to performing system testing through the GUI. The only difference in\nGUI system testing other types of testing is in how to automate the tests. Regression\ntesting refers to testing the UI after changes are made. The most common type of\nregression test tool is a capture-replay tool. Generally speaking, they capture some\nuser inputs, replay them through the UI after changes have been made, and re-\nport the differences. Dozens of capture-replay tools are available on the market,\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nEngineering Criteria for Technologies 261\n\nthe concept is fairly simple, so they is not discussed further in this chapter. Input\nvalidation testing tests how well the software recognizes and responds to invalid in-\nputs. The techniques used for input validation testing are not particularly affected\nby using a graphical user interface as opposed to other types of interface, thus this\ntopic is not discussed in this section. Finally, GUI testing refers to assessing how well\nthe GUI works. The tester asks questions such as \u201cDo all the UI controls work as\nintended?\u201d, \u201cDoes the software allow the user to navigate to all screens that the\nuser would expect?\u201d, and \u201cAre inappropriate navigations disallowed?\u201d.\n\n7.3.1 Testing GUIs\n\nOne fairly obvious technique for testing GUIs is to use some sort of finite state ma-\nchine model, then apply graph-based criteria from Chapter 2. Modeling a GUI as\na state machine is fairly straightforward, as they are naturally event-based systems.\nEvery user event (pushing a button, entering text, navigating to another screen)\ncauses a transition to a new state. A path is a sequence of edges through the tran-\nsitions, and represents one test case. An advantage of this approach is that the ex-\npected output is simply the final state that the test case input should arrive in. The\nproblem with this approach is the possibility of state explosion; even small GUIs\nwill have thousands of states and transitions.\n# \u30104\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe next section provides two different approaches to input domain modeling.\nThe interface-based approach develops characteristics directly from input parame-\nters to the program under test. The functionality-based approach develops charac-\nteristics from a functional or behavioral view of the program under test. The tester\nmust choose which approach to use. Once the IDM is developed, several coverage\ncriteria are available to decide which combinations of values to use to test the soft-\nware. These are discussed in Section 4.2.\n\n4.1.1 Interface-Based Input Domain Modeling\n\nThe interface-based approach considers each particular parameter in isolation. This\napproach is almost mechanical to follow, but the resulting tests are surprisingly\ngood.\n\nAn obvious strength of using the interface-based approach is that it is easy\nto identify characteristics. The fact that each characteristic limits itself to a sin-\ngle parameter also makes it easy to translate the abstract tests into executable test\ncases.\n\nA weakness of this approach is that not all the information available to the test\nengineer will be reflected in the interface domain model. This means that the IDM\nmay be incomplete and hence additional characteristics are needed.\n\nAnother weakness is that some parts of the functionality may depend on com-\nbinations of specific values of several interface parameters. In the interface-based\napproach each parameter is analyzed in isolation with the effect that important sub-\ncombinations may be missed.\n\nConsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. It has three integer parameters\nthat represent the lengths of three sides of a triangle. In an interface-based IDM,\nSide1 will have a number of characteristics, as will Side2 and Side3. Since the three\nvariables are all of the same type, the interface-based characteristics for each will\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n154 Coverage Criteria\n\nlikely be identical. For example, since Side1 is an integer, and zero is often a special\nvalue for integers, Relation of Side1 to zero is a reasonable interface-based charac-\nteristic.\n\n4.1.2 Functionality-Based Input Domain Modeling\n\nThe idea of the functionality-based approach is to identify characteristics that cor-\nrespond to the intended functionality of the system under test rather than using the\nactual interface. This allows the tester to incorporate some semantics or domain\nknowledge into the IDM.\n\nSome members of the community believe that a functionality-based approach\nyields better test cases than the interface-based approach because the input domain\nmodels include more semantic information. Transferring more semantic informa-\ntion from the specification to the IDM makes it more likely to generate expected\nresults for the test cases, an important goal.\n\nAnother important strength of the functionality-based approach is that the re-\nquirements are available before the software is implemented. This means that input\ndomain modeling and test case generation can start early in development.\n\nIn the functionality-based approach, identifying characteristics and values may\nbe far from trivial. If the system is large and complex, or the specifications are in-\nformal and incomplete, it can be very hard to design reasonable characteristics. The\nnext section gives practical suggestions for designing characteristics.\n\nThe functionality-based approach also makes it harder to generate tests. The\ncharacteristics of the IDM often do not map to single parameters of the software\ninterface. Translating the values into executable test cases is harder because con-\nstraints of a single IDM characteristic may affect multiple parameters in the inter-\nface.\n\nReturning to the TriTyp program from Chapter 3, a functionality-based approach\nwill recognize that instead of simply three integers, the input to the method is a\ntriangle. This leads to the characteristic of a triangle, which can be partitioned into\ndifferent types of triangles (as discussed below).\n\n4.1.3 Identifying Characteristics\n# \u30105\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nThe idea in partition coverage is that any test in a block is as good as any other\nfor testing.

Partitioning of input\ndomain D into three blocks.\n\nA common way to apply input space partitioning is to start by considering the\ndomain of each parameter separately, partitioning each domain\u2019s possible values\ninto blocks, and then combining the variables for each parameter. Sometimes the\nparameters are considered completely independently, and sometimes they are con-\nsidered in conjunction, usually by taking the semantics of the program into account.\nThis process is called input domain modeling and the next section gives more details.\n\nEach partition is usually based on some characteristic C of the program, the pro-\ngram\u2019s inputs, or the program\u2019s environment. Some possible characteristic examples\nare:\n\n\ufffd Input X is null\n\ufffd Order of file F (sorted, inverse sorted, arbitrary)\n\ufffd Min separation distance of two aircraft\n\nEach characteristic C allows the tester to define a partition. Formally, a partition\nmust satisfy two properties:\n\n1. The partition must cover the entire domain (completeness)\n2. The blocks must not overlap (disjoint)\n\nAs an example, consider the characteristic \u201corder of file F\u201d mentioned above.\nThis could be used to create the following (defective) partitioning:\n\n\ufffd Order of file F\n\u2013 b1 = Sorted in ascending order\n\u2013 b2 = Sorted in descending order\n\u2013 b3 = Arbitrary order\n\nHowever, this is not a valid partitioning. Specifically, if the file is of length 0 or 1,\nthen the file will belong in all three blocks. That is, the blocks are not disjoint. The\neasiest strategy to address this problem is to make sure that each characteristic ad-\ndresses only one property. The problem above is that the notions of being sorted\ninto ascending order and being sorted into descending order are lumped into the\nsame characteristic. Splitting into two characteristics, namely sorted ascending and\nsorted descending, solves the problem. The result is the following (valid) partition-\ning of two characteristics.\n\n\ufffd File F sorted ascending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n152 Coverage Criteria\n\n\ufffd File F sorted descending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\nWith these blocks, files of length 0 or 1 are in the True block for both characteristics.\nThe completeness and disjointness properties are formalized for pretty prag-\n\nmatic reasons, and not just to be mathematically fashionable. Partitions that are\nnot complete or disjoint probably reflect a lack of clarity in the rationale for the par-\ntition. In particular, if a partition actually encodes two or three rationales, the parti-\ntion is likely to be quite messy, and it is also likely to violate either the completeness\nor the disjointness property (or both!).

These are collectively called partition testing and include equiva-\nlence partitioning [249], boundary value analysis [249], category partition [283], and\ndomain testing [29]. An extensive survey with examples was published by Grindal\net al. [143].\n\nThe derivation of partitions and values started with Balcer, Hasling, and Os-\ntrand\u2019s category partition method in 1988 [23, 283]. An alternate visualization is\nthat of classification trees introduced by Grochtman, Grimm, and Wegener in 1993\n[145, 146]. Classification trees organize the input space partitioning information into\na tree structure. The first level nodes are the parameters and environment vari-\nables (characteristics); they may be recursively broken into sub-categories. Blocks\nappear as leaves in the tree and combinations are chosen by selecting among the\nleaves.\n\nChen et al. empirically identified common mistakes that testers made during in-\nput parameter-modeling [64]. Many of the concepts on input domain modeling in\nthis chapter come from Grindal\u2019s PhD work [140, 142, 144]. Both Cohen et al. [84]\nand Yin et al. [363] suggest functionality oriented approaches to input parameter\nmodeling. Functionality-oriented input parameter modeling was also implicitly used\nby Grindal et al. [141]. Two other IDM-related methods are Classification Trees\n[145] and a UML activity diagram based method [65]. Beizer [29], Malaiya [222],\nand Chen et al. [64] also address the problem of characteristic selection.\n\nGrindal published an analytical/empirical comparison of different constraint-\nhandling mechanisms [144].\n\nStocks and Carrington [320] provided a formal notion of specification-based test-\ning that encompasses most approaches to input space partition testing.

Cohen et al. [84] indicated that valid and invalid parameter val-\nues should be treated differently with respect to coverage. Valid values lie within\nthe bounds of normal operation of the test object, and invalid values lie outside\nthe normal operating range. Invalid values often result in an error message and the\nexecution terminates. To avoid one invalid value masking another, Cohen et al. sug-\ngested that only one invalid value should be included in each test case.\n# \u30107\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n\ufffd File F sorted ascending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n152 Coverage Criteria\n\n\ufffd File F sorted descending\n\u2013 b1 = True\n\u2013 b2 = False\n\nWith these blocks, files of length 0 or 1 are in the True block for both characteristics.\nThe completeness and disjointness properties are formalized for pretty prag-\n\nmatic reasons, and not just to be mathematically fashionable. Partitions that are\nnot complete or disjoint probably reflect a lack of clarity in the rationale for the par-\ntition. In particular, if a partition actually encodes two or three rationales, the parti-\ntion is likely to be quite messy, and it is also likely to violate either the completeness\nor the disjointness property (or both!). Identifying and correcting completeness or\ndisjointness errors typically results in esthetically more pleasing partitions. Further,\nformally objectionable \u201cpartitions\u201d cause unnecessary problems when generating\ntests, as discussed below. The rest of this chapter assumes that the partitions are\nboth complete and disjoint.\n\n4.1 INPUT DOMAIN MODELING\n\nThe first step in input domain modeling is identification of testable functions. Con-\nsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. TriTyp clearly has only one testable func-\ntion with three parameters. The situation is more complex for Java class APIs. Each\npublic method is typically a testable function that should be tested individually.\nHowever, the characteristics are often the same for several methods, so it helps to\ndevelop a common set of characteristics for the entire class and then develop spe-\ncific tests for each method. Finally, large systems are certainly amenable to the in-\nput space partition approach, and such systems often supply complex functionality.\nTools like UML use cases can be used to identify testable functions. Each use case\nis associated with a specific intended functionality of the system, so it is very likely\nthat the use case designers have useful characteristics in mind that are relevant to\ndeveloping test cases. For example, a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d use case for an ATM identifies\n\u201cwithdrawing cash\u201d as a testable function. Further, it suggests useful categories such\nas \u201cIs Card Valid?\u201d and \u201cRelation of Withdrawal Policy to Withdrawal Request.\u201d\n\nThe second step is to identify all of the parameters that can affect the behavior\nof a given testable function. This step isn\u2019t particularly creative, but it is important\nto carry it out completely. In the simple case of testing a stateless method, the pa-\nrameters are simply the formal parameters to the method. If the method has state,\nwhich is common in many object-oriented classes, then the state must be included\nas a parameter. For example, the insert(Comparable obj) method for a binary tree\nclass behaves differently depending on whether or not obj is already in the tree.\nHence, the current state of the tree needs to be explicitly identified as a parameter\nto the insert() method. In a slightly more complex example, a method find(String\nstr) that finds the location of str in a file depends, obviously, on the particular file\nbeing searched. Hence, the test engineer explicitly identifies the file as a parameter\nto the find() method. Together, all of the parameters form the input domain of the\nfunction under test.\n\nThe third step, and the key creative engineering step, is modeling the input do-\nmain articulated in the prior step. An input domain model (IDM) represents the\ninput space of the system under test in an abstract way.

This must be documented in the IDM. For example, Table 4.7 shows\nan example based on the previously described boolean findElement (list, element)\nmethod. An IDM with two parameters A, that has four partitions, and B, that has\nthree partitions, has been designed. Two of the partition combinations do not make\nsense and are thus invalid. In this example, these are represented as a list of invalid\npairs of parameter partitions. In the general case other representations can be used,\nfor example, a set of inequalities.\n\nConstraints are relations between blocks from different characteristics. Two\nkinds of constraints appear. One kind says that a block from one characteristic can-\nnot be combined with a block from another characteristic. The \u201cless than zero\u201d and\n\u201cscalene\u201d problem is an example of this kind of constraint. The other kind is the in-\nverse; a block from one characteristic must be combined with a specific block from\nanother characteristic. Although this sounds simple enough, identifying and satisfy-\ning the constraints when choosing values can be difficult.\n# \u30109\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nInput Space Partitioning 157\n\nTable 4.2.

If one value is chosen from each block, the\nresult is three tests. For example, we might choose Side 1 to have the value 7 in test\n1, 0 in test 2, and \u22123 in test 3. Of course, we also need values for Side 2 and Side\n3 of the triangle to complete the test case values. Notice that some of the blocks\nrepresent valid triangles and some represent invalid triangles. For example, no valid\ntriangle can have a side of negative length.\n\nIt is easy to refine this categorization to get more fine grained testing if the bud-\nget allows. For example, more blocks can be created by separating inputs with value\n1. This decision leads to a partitioning with four blocks, as shown in Table 4.2.\n\nNotice that if the value for Side 1 were floating point rather than integer, the\nsecond categorization would not yield valid partitions. None of the blocks would\ninclude values between 0 and 1 (noninclusive), so the blocks would not cover the\ndomain (not be complete). However, the domain D contains integers so the parti-\ntions are valid.\n\nWhile partitioning, it is often useful for the tester to identify candidate values for\neach block to be used in testing. The reason to identify values now is that choosing\nspecific values can help the test engineer think more concretely about the predicates\nthat describe each block. While these values may not prove sufficient when refining\ntest requirements to test cases, they do form a good starting point. Table 4.3 shows\nvalues that can satisfy the second partitioning.\n\nThe above partitioning is interface based and only uses syntactic information\nabout the program (it has three integer inputs). A functionality-based approach can\nuse the semantic information of the traditional geometric classification of triangles,\nas shown in Table 4.4.\n\nOf course, the tester has to know what makes a triangle scalene, equilateral,\nisosceles, and invalid to choose possible values (this may be simple middle school\ngeometry, but many of us have probably forgotten). An equilateral triangle is one in\nwhich all sides are the same length. An isosceles triangle is one in which at least two\nsides are the same length. A scalene triangle is any other valid triangle. This brings\nup a subtle problem, Table 4.4 does not form a valid partitioning. An equilateral tri-\nangle is also isosceles, thus we must first correct the partitions, as shown in Table 4.5.\n\nTable 4.3.

This allows the tester to incorporate some semantics or domain\nknowledge into the IDM.\n\nSome members of the community believe that a functionality-based approach\nyields better test cases than the interface-based approach because the input domain\nmodels include more semantic information. Transferring more semantic informa-\ntion from the specification to the IDM makes it more likely to generate expected\nresults for the test cases, an important goal.\n\nAnother important strength of the functionality-based approach is that the re-\nquirements are available before the software is implemented. This means that input\ndomain modeling and test case generation can start early in development.\n\nIn the functionality-based approach, identifying characteristics and values may\nbe far from trivial. If the system is large and complex, or the specifications are in-\nformal and incomplete, it can be very hard to design reasonable characteristics. The\nnext section gives practical suggestions for designing characteristics.\n\nThe functionality-based approach also makes it harder to generate tests. The\ncharacteristics of the IDM often do not map to single parameters of the software\ninterface. Translating the values into executable test cases is harder because con-\nstraints of a single IDM characteristic may affect multiple parameters in the inter-\nface.\n\nReturning to the TriTyp program from Chapter 3, a functionality-based approach\nwill recognize that instead of simply three integers, the input to the method is a\ntriangle. This leads to the characteristic of a triangle, which can be partitioned into\ndifferent types of triangles (as discussed below).\n\n4.1.3 Identifying Characteristics\n\nIdentifying characteristics in an interface-based approach is simple. There is\na mechanical translation from the parameters to characteristics. Developing a\nfunctionality-based IDM is more challenging.\n\nPreconditions are excellent sources for functionality-based characteristics. They\nmay be explicit or encoded in the software as exceptional behavior. Preconditions\nexplicitly separate defined (or normal) behavior from undefined (or exceptional)\nbehavior. For example, if a method choose() is supposed to select a value, it needs\na precondition that a value must be available to select. A characteristic may be\nwhether the value is available or not.\n\nPostconditions are also good sources for characteristics. In the case of TriTyp, the\ndifferent kinds of triangles are based on the postcondition of the method.\n\nThe test engineer should also look for other relationships between variables.\nThese may be explicit or implicit. For example, a curious test engineer given a\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 155\n\nmethod m() with two object parameters x and y might wonder what happens if x\nand y point to the same object (aliasing), or to logically equal objects.\n\nAnother possible idea is to check for missing factors, that is, factors that may\nimpact the execution but do not have an associated IDM parameter.\n\nIt is usually better to have many characteristics with few blocks than the reverse.\nIt is also true that characteristics with small numbers of blocks are more likely to\nsatisfy the disjointness and completeness properties.\n\nGenerally, it is preferable for the test engineer to use specifications or other\ndocumentation instead of program code to develop characteristics. The idea is\nthat the tester should apply input space partitioning by using domain knowledge\nabout the problem, not the implementation. However, in practice, the code may\nbe all that is available. Overall, the more semantic information the test engi-\nneer can incorporate into characteristics, the better the resulting test set is likely\nto be.\n# \u301011\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nBeizer\u2019s book [29] includes a chapter on DNF testing, including a variant of IC\ncoverage for f , but not f\u0304 , and an extensive development of Karnaugh maps. We\ndo not address criteria defined predicates expressed in conjunctive normal form\n(CNF). The reason is that every DNF coverage criteria has a dual in CNF. Kuhn\n[194] developed the first fault detection relations; this work was greatly expanded\nby Yu, Lau, and Chen, who developed much of the key material relating DNF cov-\nerage criteria to fault detecting ability. Two good papers to begin study of this\ntopic are by Chen and Lau [63], which develops a variety of coverage criteria, in-\ncluding CUTPNFP, and Lau and Yu [202], which is the source for the fault class\nhierarchy shown in Figure 3.6. In personal communications, Greg Williams and\nGary Kaminski provided the authors with valuable assistance in organizing and ex-\npanding the DNF fault detection material. Greg Williams also developed the coun-\nterexample to show that UTPC and the ACC criteria do not share a subsumption\nrelation.\n\nNOTES\n\n1 In practice, this \u201cthought\u201d turned out to be the collective effort of many researchers, who\npublished dozens of papers over a period of several decades.\n\n2 Old hands at testing may recognize and even be tired of the triangle example. It is used\nas a teaching tool for the same reasons it has staying power in the literature: it\u2019s a familiar\nproblem; the control structure is interesting enough to illustrate most issues; and it does\nnot use language features that make this analysis really hard, such as loops and indirect\nreferences. This version of TriTyp is a bit overly complicated, but that does help illustrate\nthe concepts.\n\n3 The notion of mutation operators developed in the Chapter 5 is closely related to the notion\nof fault classes presented here.\n\n\n\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\n4\n\nInput Space Partitioning\n\nIn a very fundamental way, all testing is about choosing elements from the input\nspace of the software being tested. The criteria presented previously can be viewed\nas defining ways to divide the input space according to the test requirements. The\nassumption is that any collection of values that satisfies the same test requirement\nwill be \u201cjust as good.\u201d Input space partitioning takes that view in a much more di-\nrect way. The input domain is defined in terms of the possible values that the input\nparameters can have. The input parameters can be method parameters and global\nvariables, objects representing current state, or user-level inputs to a program, de-\npending on what kind of software artifact is being analyzed. The input domain is\nthen partitioned into regions that are assumed to contain equally useful values from\na testing perspective, and values are selected from each region.\n\nThis way of testing has several advantages. It is fairly easy to get started be-\ncause it can be applied with no automation and very little training. The tester\ndoes not need to understand the implementation; everything is based on a descrip-\ntion of the inputs. It is also simple to \u201ctune\u201d the technique to get more or fewer\ntests.\n\nConsider an abstract partition q over some domain D. The partition q defines a\nset of equivalence classes, which we simply call blocks, Bq.1 The blocks are pairwise\ndisjoint, that is\n\nbi \u2229 bj = \u2205, i \ufffd= j ; bi , bj \u2208 Bq\n\nand together the blocks cover the domain D, that is\n\u22c3\n\nb\u2208Bq\n\nb = D\n# \u301012\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nSpecial values can often be used. Consider a Java reference variable; null is typ-\nically a special case that needs to be treated differently from non null values. If the\nreference is to a container structure such as a Set or List, then whether the container\nis empty or not is often a useful characteristic.\n\nConsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. It has three integer parameters\nthat represent the lengths of three sides of a triangle. One common partitioning\nfor an integer variable considers the relation of the variable\u2019s value to some special\nvalue in the testable function\u2019s domain, such as zero.\n\nTable 4.1 shows a partitioning for the interface-based IDM for the TriTyp pro-\ngram. It has three characteristics, q1, q2, and q3.\n\nThe first row in the table should be read as \u201cBlock q1.b1 is that Side 1 is greater\nthan zero,\u201d \u201cBlock q1.b2 is that Side 1 is equal to zero,\u201d and \u201cBlock q1.b3 is that Side\n1 is less than zero.\u201d\n\nTable 4.1.

If one value is chosen from each block, the\nresult is three tests. For example, we might choose Side 1 to have the value 7 in test\n1, 0 in test 2, and \u22123 in test 3. Of course, we also need values for Side 2 and Side\n3 of the triangle to complete the test case values. Notice that some of the blocks\nrepresent valid triangles and some represent invalid triangles. For example, no valid\ntriangle can have a side of negative length.\n\nIt is easy to refine this categorization to get more fine grained testing if the bud-\nget allows. For example, more blocks can be created by separating inputs with value\n1. This decision leads to a partitioning with four blocks, as shown in Table 4.2.\n\nNotice that if the value for Side 1 were floating point rather than integer, the\nsecond categorization would not yield valid partitions. None of the blocks would\ninclude values between 0 and 1 (noninclusive), so the blocks would not cover the\ndomain (not be complete). However, the domain D contains integers so the parti-\ntions are valid.\n# \u301013\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nDynamic analysis techniques are the most promising way to address these\nproblems, however, these problems are why analysis-based techniques are mostly\nconsidered to apply to small structures such as program units.\n\nThe most recent automatic test data generation approach uses search techniques\nsuch as genetic algorithms. Search-based approaches have several advantages, in-\ncluding being easy to implement and being very flexible. They cannot use as much\ninformation as the analysis-based methods, and thus can get stuck on values that\nare hard to find. For example, if a search-based technique is used to achieve edge\ncoverage on a method-level control flow graph, a predicate such as x+y = z presents\ndifficulty for search-based techniques. This problem is compounded if several such\npredicates have to be satisfied to reach a portion of the method. For this reason,\nsearch-based techniques have so far achieved more success at the system level than\nthe unit level.\n\n9.4 BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTES\n\nAn excellent, if slightly dated, place to start on software for safety critical systems\nis Leveson\u2019s book [207].

A functionality-based approach can\nuse the semantic information of the traditional geometric classification of triangles,\nas shown in Table 4.4.\n\nOf course, the tester has to know what makes a triangle scalene, equilateral,\nisosceles, and invalid to choose possible values (this may be simple middle school\ngeometry, but many of us have probably forgotten). An equilateral triangle is one in\nwhich all sides are the same length. An isosceles triangle is one in which at least two\nsides are the same length. A scalene triangle is any other valid triangle. This brings\nup a subtle problem, Table 4.4 does not form a valid partitioning. An equilateral tri-\nangle is also isosceles, thus we must first correct the partitions, as shown in Table 4.5.\n\nTable 4.3.

The triplets rep-\nresent the three sides of the triangle.\n\nA different approach to the equilateral/isosceles problem above is to break\nthe characteristic Geometric Partitioning into four separate characteristics, namely\nScalene, Isosceles, Equilateral, and Valid. The partition for each of these character-\nistics is boolean, and the fact that choosing Equilateral = true also means choosing\nIsosceles = true is then simply a constraint. Such an approach is highly recommended,\nand it invariably satisfies the disjointness and completeness properties.\n\n4.1.5 Using More than One Input Domain Model\n\nFor a complex program it might be better to have several small IDMs than one large.\nThis approach allows for a divide-and-conquer strategy when modeling character-\nistics and blocks. Another advantage with multiple IDMs for the same software is\nthat it allows varying levels of coverage.\n\nFor instance, one IDM may contain only valid values and another IDM may con-\ntain invalid values to focus on error handling. The valid value IDM may be covered\nusing a higher level of coverage. The invalid value IDM may use a lower level of\ncoverage.\n\nMultiple IDMs may be overlapping as long as the test cases generated make\nsense. However, overlapping IDMs are likely to have more constraints.\n\n4.1.6 Checking the Input Domain Model\n\nIt is important to check the input domain model. In terms of characteristics, the\ntest engineer should ask whether there is any information about how the function\nbehaves that is not incorporated in some characteristics. This is necessarily an infor-\nmal process.\n\nThe tester should also explicitly check each characteristic for the completeness\nand disjointness properties. The purpose of this check is to make sure that, for each\ncharacteristic, not only do the blocks cover the complete input space, but selecting\na particular block implies excluding all other blocks in that characteristic.\n\nIf multiple IDMs are used, completeness should be relative to the portion of the\ninput domain that is modeled in each IDM. When the tester is satisfied with the\n# \u301015\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\nintrotest CUUS047-Ammann ISBN 9780521880381 November 8, 2007 17:13 Char Count= 0\n\nInput Space Partitioning 165\n\nTable 4.7.

This must be documented in the IDM. For example, Table 4.7 shows\nan example based on the previously described boolean findElement (list, element)\nmethod. An IDM with two parameters A, that has four partitions, and B, that has\nthree partitions, has been designed. Two of the partition combinations do not make\nsense and are thus invalid. In this example, these are represented as a list of invalid\npairs of parameter partitions. In the general case other representations can be used,\nfor example, a set of inequalities.\n\nConstraints are relations between blocks from different characteristics. Two\nkinds of constraints appear. One kind says that a block from one characteristic can-\nnot be combined with a block from another characteristic. The \u201cless than zero\u201d and\n\u201cscalene\u201d problem is an example of this kind of constraint. The other kind is the in-\nverse; a block from one characteristic must be combined with a specific block from\nanother characteristic. Although this sounds simple enough, identifying and satisfy-\ning the constraints when choosing values can be difficult.\n\nHow constraints are handled when values are selected depends on the coverage\ncriterion chosen, and the decision is usually made when values are chosen. For the\nACoC, PWC, and TWC criteria, the only reasonable option is to drop the infeasible\npairs from consideration. For example, if PWC requires a particular pair that is not\nfeasible, no amount of tinkering on the test engineer\u2019s part can make that require-\nment feasible. However, the situation is quite different for a criterion such as BCC.\nIf a particular variation (for example, \u201cless than zero\u201d for \u201cRelation of Side 1 to\nzero\u201d) conflicts with the base case (for example, \u201cscalene\u201d for \u201cGeometric Classi-\nfication\u201d), then the obvious thing to do is change the offending choice for the base\ncase so that the variation is feasible. In this case, \u201cGeometric Classification\u201d clearly\nneeds to change to \u201cinvalid.\u201d\n\nAs another example, consider sorting an array. The input to our sort routine will\nbe a variable length array of some arbitrary type. The output will have three parts:\n(1) a permutation of the input array, sorted in ascending order, (2) the largest value\n(max), and (3) the smallest value (min).

Many of the concepts on input domain modeling in\nthis chapter come from Grindal\u2019s PhD work [140, 142, 144]. Both Cohen et al. [84]\nand Yin et al. [363] suggest functionality oriented approaches to input parameter\nmodeling. Functionality-oriented input parameter modeling was also implicitly used\nby Grindal et al. [141]. Two other IDM-related methods are Classification Trees\n[145] and a UML activity diagram based method [65]. Beizer [29], Malaiya [222],\nand Chen et al. [64] also address the problem of characteristic selection.\n\nGrindal published an analytical/empirical comparison of different constraint-\nhandling mechanisms [144].\n\nStocks and Carrington [320] provided a formal notion of specification-based test-\ning that encompasses most approaches to input space partition testing.

Cohen et al. [84] indicated that valid and invalid parameter val-\nues should be treated differently with respect to coverage. Valid values lie within\nthe bounds of normal operation of the test object, and invalid values lie outside\nthe normal operating range. Invalid values often result in an error message and the\nexecution terminates. To avoid one invalid value masking another, Cohen et al. sug-\ngested that only one invalid value should be included in each test case.\n\nBurroughs et al. [58] and Cohen et al. [84, 85, 86] suggested the heuristic pair-\nwise coverage as part of the Automatic Efficient Test Generator (AETG). AETG\nalso includes a variation on the base choice combination criterion. In AETG\u2019s ver-\nsion, called \u201cdefault testing,\u201d the tester varies the values of one characteristic at a\ntime while the other characteristics contain some default value. The term \u201cdefault\ntesting\u201d was also used by Burr and Young [57], who described yet another varia-\ntion of the base choices. In their version, all characteristics except one contain the\ndefault value, and the remaining characteristics contain a maximum or a minimum\nvalue. This variant will not necessarily satisfy \u201ceach choice coverage.\u201d\n\nThe Constrained Array Test System (CATS) tool for generating test cases\nwas described by Sherwood [313] to satisfy pair-wise coverage. For programs with\ntwo or more characteristics, the in-parameter-order (IPO) combination strategy\n[205, 206, 322] generates a test suite that satisfies pair-wise coverage for the first\ntwo parameters (characteristic in our terminology). The test suite is then extended\nto satisfy pair-wise coverage for the first three parameters and continues for each\nadditional parameter until all parameters are included.\n# \u301018\u2020Introduction to Software Testing.pdf\u2020file-VeSD9wyYSHTkA5o2PGN1rr\u3011\n4.1.4 Choosing Blocks and Values\n\nAfter choosing characteristics, the test engineer partitions the domains of the char-\nacteristics into sets of values called blocks. A key issue in any partition approach is\nhow partitions should be identified and how representative values should be selected\nfrom each block. This is another creative design step that allows the tester to tune\nthe test process. More blocks will result in more tests, requiring more resources but\npossibly finding more faults. Fewer blocks will result in fewer tests, saving resources\nbut possibly reducing test effectiveness. Several general strategies for identifying\nvalues are as follows:\n\n\ufffd Valid values: Include at least one group of valid values.\n\ufffd Sub-partition: A range of valid values can often be partitioned into sub-\n\npartitions, such that each sub-partition exercises a somewhat different part of\nthe functionality.\n\n\ufffd Boundaries: Values at or close to boundaries often cause problems.\n\ufffd Normal use: If the operational profile focuses heavily on \u201cnormal use,\u201d the fail-\n\nure rate depends on values that are not boundary conditions.\n\ufffd Invalid values: Include at least one group of invalid values.\n\ufffd Balance: From a cost perspective, it may be cheap or even free to add more\n\nblocks to characteristics that have fewer blocks. In Section 4.2, we will see that\nthe number of tests sometimes depends on the characteristic with the maximum\nnumber of blocks.\n\n\ufffd Missing partitions: Check that the union of all blocks of a characteristic com-\npletely covers the input space of that characteristic.\n\n\ufffd Overlapping partitions: Check that no value belongs to more than one block.\n\nSpecial values can often be used. Consider a Java reference variable; null is typ-\nically a special case that needs to be treated differently from non null values. If the\nreference is to a container structure such as a Set or List, then whether the container\nis empty or not is often a useful characteristic.\n\nConsider the TriTyp program from Chapter 3. It has three integer parameters\nthat represent the lengths of three sides of a triangle. One common partitioning\nfor an integer variable considers the relation of the variable\u2019s value to some special\nvalue in the testable function\u2019s domain, such as zero.\n\nTable 4.1 shows a partitioning for the interface-based IDM for the TriTyp pro-\ngram. It has three characteristics, q1, q2, and q3.\n\nThe first row in the table should be read as \u201cBlock q1.b1 is that Side 1 is greater\nthan zero,\u201d \u201cBlock q1.b2 is that Side 1 is equal to zero,\u201d and \u201cBlock q1.b3 is that Side\n1 is less than zero.\u201d\n\nTable 4.1.

Let\u2019s begin **Module 4: Black Box Testing** with the first core topic:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Topic 1: **Domain Testing / Input Space Partitioning (ISP)**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Textbook Reference**:  \n- **Chapter 4: Input Space Partitioning**, Pages **150\u2013170**  \n- Key Figures: **Figure 4.1 (Page 151)**, Tables **4.1 to 4.6**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 What is Domain Testing?\n\n> **Domain Testing**, also called **Input Space Partitioning (ISP)**, is a black-box testing method that divides the **input domain** into **partitions (blocks)** and selects representative values from each.\n\n\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Quote (\ud83d\udccdPage 150):  \n> \"*All testing is about choosing elements from the input space\u2026 ISP formalizes this idea by dividing the space into blocks from which values are selected.*\"\u301065:1\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Why Use ISP?\n\n- It\u2019s **efficient**: Testers don\u2019t need to test every input.\n- Covers **equivalence classes**.\n- Useful for **boundary value testing**.\n- Doesn\u2019t need knowledge of code internals (true black-box approach).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd38 Key Concepts in Input Space Partitioning\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Input Domain Model (IDM)**\n\n> Abstract representation of input space, where the tester defines **input characteristics** and **partitions** them into **blocks**.\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Page 153**, Section 4.1\u301065:0\u2020source\u3011\n\n- Each block contains values considered **equivalent** for testing.\n- Blocks must be:\n  - **Disjoint** (no overlap)\n  - **Complete** (cover full domain)\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f **Figure 4.1 (Page 151)**:\nIllustrates input domain `D` divided into blocks `b1`, `b2`, `b3`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Two Modeling Approaches**:\n\n#### a. **Interface-Based IDM**  \n\ud83d\udcd8 **Section 4.1.1, Page 153\u2013154**  \n- Based on program parameters.\n- Easy to apply, mechanical.\n- May miss interactions between inputs.\n\nExample (TriTyp Program):  \n- Side1: `>0`, `=0`, `<0`\n- Side2, Side3: same categories\n\n#### b. **Functionality-Based IDM**  \n\ud83d\udcd8 **Section 4.1.2, Page 154\u2013155**  \n- Based on program **semantics**, **requirements**\n- More thorough, captures **meaning** behind inputs\n\nExample (TriTyp):  \n- Triangle Types: **Equilateral**, **Isosceles**, **Scalene**, **Invalid**\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Table 4.4 & 4.5 (Page 158\u2013159): Corrected partitions for triangle type\u301065:14\u2020source\u3011\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Choosing Blocks & Values**\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Section 4.1.4, Page 157\u2013158**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Choose:\n- Valid and invalid values\n- Boundary values\n- Sub-partitions\n- Special values (like `null`, 0, empty)\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Example:  \nFor variable `age`, define:\n- `<0` (invalid)\n- `0\u201312` (child)\n- `13\u201319` (teen)\n- `20\u201359` (adult)\n- `60+` (senior)\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Constraints Among Partitions**\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 **Section 4.3, Page 165**, Table 4.7\n\nSome block combinations are **infeasible**:\n- E.g., \u201cnegative length\u201d and \u201cscalene triangle\u201d \u2013 logically invalid\n\nYou must handle:\n- **Conflicting blocks**\n- **Required pairings**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Mini Example \u2013 Testing Triangle Program\n\nInterface-Based:\n| Side1 | Side2 | Side3 | Block |\n|-------|-------|--------|-------|\n| 3     | 3     | 3      | Equilateral |\n| 3     | 3     | 5      | Isosceles |\n| 3     | 4     | 5      | Scalene |\n| 0     | 5     | 5      | Invalid |\n\nFunctionality-Based:\n| Characteristic       | Blocks            |\n|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Triangle Type        | Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, Invalid |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf93 CST458 Exam Tips\n\n- **Part A (3 marks)**:\n  - \u201cDefine input space partitioning.\u201d\n  - \u201cWhat is an input domain model?\u201d\n- **Part B (14 marks)**:\n  - \u201cExplain domain testing using interface and functionality-based IDM. Use TriTyp example.\u201d\n  - Include diagrams and tables (like Table 4.4 and 4.5)\n\n\ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f Diagrams of block partitioning or triangle classification **help score full marks**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd16 Page Reference Summary\n\n| Concept                             | Page | Table/Figure |\n|------------------------------------|------|--------------|\n| ISP Concept & IDM                  | 150\u2013153 | Fig. 4.1 |\n| Interface-Based Modeling           | 153\u2013154 | Table 4.2 |\n| Functionality-Based Modeling       | 154\u2013155 | Table 4.4 |\n| Valid Partitions (Fixed TriTyp)    | 158\u2013159 | Table 4.5 |\n| Choosing values, constraints       | 157\u2013165 | Table 4.6, 4.7 |\n\n---\n\nShall we continue to the next topic:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Black Box Testing \u2013 Functional Testing Techniques, Boundary Testing, Equivalence Partitioning, etc.?**"
